<p>I was pointing out yesterday that where there is choice there must be conflict, and any action born out of choice must be limited. Man is free to choose and thereby we are limited, because we have the capacity to choose. Our capacity limits our discernment, and it is only when you are free of choice that there is true liberation. So action born out of choice is limited.</p>
<p>Most of our action is based either through an external influence of society, of laws, morality, etc., and that action - which is reaction - must inherently be limited. Then we escape from that external reaction and develop our own, individual, temperamental reaction, which again creates reaction, the ‘I’ and the non ‘I’.</p>
<p>So, when you examine most of your actions frankly, then you will see that they are born either out of fear of punishment or reward. Our actions are based on this, and hence cannot have spontaneity. I am using this word in a quite different meaning. I will try to explain it. A man of superficial feelings, of superficial thought is spontaneous; he is too spontaneous. He has no fear, no consideration. So he is acting in a certain way out of an impulse; so in a certain way he acts spontaneously. In people who are not burdened with the fear of what society says, of what the neighbors say, because they are acting from their own impulses, there is a certain spontaneity, but I do not call that real spontaneity. That action is thoughtless action. To me, spontaneous action comes only when mind and heart are in perfect harmony. That needs tremendous fullness, complete lightness, not a superficial action.</p>
<p>To realize, and to let action be born out of that realization, we must question the standards developed by society; otherwise, you can never find out whether you are acting through exterior influences or through reaction, which you have established for yourself as your own standard. To have an external standard to which one reacts, and to have an inner standard to which one reacts are both false because the inner standard which one develops is but a reaction. It is not the fullness. To realize what I call spontaneous, rich, full action, one must question the value which society has set about us and thereby discover that true significance.</p>
<p>And to question truly the problem, there must be a great crisis. You cannot discover it intellectually. It must become an intense problem. It is only when you are in a crisis that you come to discover the right values, not when you are merely superficially examining. Most of us want to avoid a direct frank questioning of standards: religious, social demands, social standards, class distinction. So you can only find out true values, the true significance, when you question it in a crisis. Now, most of us want to avoid or take as accepted any problem, or run away from it. Hence, we never discover its true significance.</p>
<p>If you are in a crisis of any kind, when you have to decide something vital, real, what do you do? You approach it with your whole being, not only mentally or emotionally, but harmoniously. Out of that there is a decision that is not born out of choice. Please think on it and you will see. When you are in a crisis, you are not seeking a solution. Search for a solution is merely escape. You can easily find a solution, an escape, but to discover the true significance of the problem, of the crisis, you must come with a fullness, with your mind and heart in complete union. When there is a crisis, when you have to decide something very important, you begin to think, and gradually out of that, the decision is born and there is no choice. You don’t weigh the opposite - on the contrary. You do that only when you do not calculate, when there is a direct discernment only, when the problem is a real, vital problem.</p>
<p>One must live intensely all the time with full consciousness, facing everything as it comes, frankly, not sincerely. That is what I explained yesterday, so that every incident is regarded intrinsically for its own sake, not in comparison with what you are going to get out of it. So you discover individually the true significance of all the standards which society has imposed on each individual.</p>
<p>So, in discovering the right significance, you either break away from society and the whole structure of society, or you may find for yourself that you agree with society. That depends on the intensity, vitality, frankness with which you approach the problem.</p>
<p>Take the question of possession and nonpossession of property. Through centuries, the law has allowed you to possess land, property, children, wife, jewels. It is allowed, and we have created that problem through centuries of craving, greed, desire for power, and we have become slaves of that legislation. Then another legislation will come that says you shall not possess. Then you will become the slaves of that legislation also - whereas, if you understand the true significance of the problem, then you are free of possession and nonpossession. I shall explain that. If it is not clear, ask me questions.</p>
<p>So, in discovering right values, action is born out of completeness that is harmonious, spontaneous, and that action is of life itself, and therefore it is infinite. To me, action is not achievement. An action which is born out of a desire for achievement is no true action, it is limitation; whereas, action born out of the spontaneity of fullness is infinite. As we are free to choose, and our action is born out of that choice, and there is no discernment, our action is limited; it is not spontaneous. Whereas, when action is born through the discernment of right values - which comes only when you question intensely, as in a crisis - then such action is infinite and spontaneous, because it is not born out of choice.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>What would you think of a camp without you, where the people could come to a certain general explanation of what they have found in you, and of what they are missing in you?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why not? If you want to meet here when I am not here, what is the harm? I don’t quite understand why this question is put. Sir, are you saying you have to come together to find out what I have said and what I am, and what you are missing or getting, and in order to discover that, you must come together? Cannot you discern for yourself individually, now? I don’t think that is the implication of the question. Can there be a camp without me? I do not understand why not. I am not going to be here next year, and if Mr. Folkersma and others decide it, I don’t see why you should not do it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Is your opinion of not being able to help anybody not illogical and even contradictory to your convictions, for by coming here you give the impression of being able to help. After all, your writings are sufficient.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I will explain what I mean by not being able to help. Most people want to be influenced in one way or the other, and they think by coming to a religious teacher they will be influenced in a right direction through the aura, atmosphere, etc. Being influenced along a particular line, I call detrimental. I do not want to influence anyone. What the majority of people want is for me to give them strength, power, will to push them along right lines, to encourage them. I do not intend to help anyone that way because I think it is utterly false. To discover what is everlastingly true, you must be absolutely free of all influences. You must stand in the integrity of the aloneness, and then you will find out; whereas, what I can do by talking and writing is to point out. I cannot fundamentally help. To me, it is an erroneous idea that another can give you that living truth. None can give it to you. It must be born out of your own comprehension, out of your own experience. Experience is not going from one incident to another, but the comprehension of that incident with all its significance, at the right moment, with the right attention, with the right attitude.</p>
<p>I can make things clear - at least, I can try to - and point out what to me are utter fallacies, and it is for you to act on that if you desire, out of your own thinking, out of your own comprehension, uninfluenced, without fear. Most religious leaders and organizations tend to increase and to emphasize the subtle fears and nonacceptance of opportunities, which create fears and subtle influences, which you divide along a certain line. Those things to me are utterly false. So I do not hold that my position is illogical. I am acting from that aloneness, from that eternal thing. I do not want to influence and I don’t want you to follow me. I say, to understand life you must come to it with a choiceless mind, a mind that is free of time, that is no longer being consistent - which does not mean that it is inconsistent, or must be inconsistent.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Can you take for granted that life or truth or God, or whatever name you give to the highest, has made such a hopeless mistake by letting us have absolutely wrong use of mind and reason, as your opinion would make us suppose?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have got the capacity to reason, the capacity to feel, and it does not matter who created it. Who created it is not the important thing for the moment. What is important is that the wrong use of such reason, such feeling has brought about such chaotic conditions in the world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Just as in former years, many people tried to make you out a Theosophist - if rather an erring one - now there exists the opinion that you are something like an ultra-idealistic and glorified communist. This opinion has been broadly hinted at in print, and it would be good to clear up the point. The idea expressed is, that you are the ideal spiritual communist of a communism that perhaps will never exist in the material world, but rather of the “higher plane” kind of communism that will always be the aspiration of its true leaders. What have you to say to that? But please be very plain and clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t think I am a communist or a fascist; I approach the whole thing quite differently. The problem of possession and nonpossession, and all the complications in the world, will have their right significance when men approach them rightly, not by choosing or by emphasizing whether you must possess or not possess - that is of very little importance. If man is complete in himself, these things will have very little value.</p>
<p>If man is complete in himself, self-sufficient, then all these problems will have minor importance and therefore will be solved. My whole attitude is to show to the individual, to each of you, how to be complete for yourselves, and then these problems will be solved without your even discussing them. I feel because we are incomplete, because there is no real spiritual existence, real completeness, then you look to all these things to give you strength, happiness, security, and hence these problems become tremendously increased out of proportion. The more you investigate, the more you will see that this is a false emphasis. It is first necessary to understand. You say, bread is necessary to be complete, to live. Don’t put bread or completeness first, but approach whole thing rightly. You cannot live by bread alone, nor can you live by spirituality alone, but if you understand the true significance of living, both have their right place. Now please, I am not giving solace to the bourgeois, nor encouraging the people who have given up their possessions. Possessions, accumulations, the question of inheriting, all these things will have lost their savor if in yourself you are complete; and that is far more difficult, that needs far greater vitality, greater discernment, than the struggle for possessions which are easy to acquire.</p>
<p>As I say, I don’t belong to the communist party, nor do I belong to the fascist party. I am a human being, and I say that is far more important than to what party I belong. If one is a complete human being, one is divine, and then no party, no system is of value. One is like the wind that is pliable and fits in with all things; in oneself one is complete.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You abhor power. What does that word signify to you? I differentiate between power used in three ways: 1. To injure or exploit or hamper the growth of another for one’s own aggrandizement. 2. Presumptuously to interfere in an endeavor to help. 3. Opportunely to share one’s knowledge or power with others. Does your use of the term</span> power <i>include or exclude No. 3?</i></p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Your question is like an examination paper. I have answered this question in my first talk. When there is search for security - economically, emotionally, or mentally - then there is search for power, because you derive comfort from the security and domination, not only over yourself, but also over others. We are unconsciously seeking comfort, and comfort implies limitations, consistency to the principles of yesterday which have become the principles of today, and we are living according to the edicts of the desire for security. Hence we do not comprehend the incidents, pictures, and images of life. So, if one understands the cause of this search for security, then the desire for power ceases. As I said, the cause of the search for security is this lack of sufficiency, this aching loneliness, and you hope to cover up this loneliness by having greater and greater security, and thereby you create more and more fear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>As I live day by day, I don’t feel I get much nearer to liberation; but looking back, say to the last camp, I feel that have eliminated various unessentials and got nearer to an understanding of life. Is liberation a gradual thing?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I see, you look at liberation as a finality, as a thing to be achieved. As I said the other day, what is achieved is not lasting. Liberation is not a thing to be gained; it is not a portal to which you get nearer and nearer by action. Action itself is liberation, when action itself is spontaneous, whole, complete, born out of that full aloneness. You may have changed since the last camp. I have too. Your hair may become gray, so has mine. We are getting older; we may get rid of certain forms of thought and have some others, but this surely is not a measure by which you judge liberation, is it? You will know that liberation is complete when it is harmonious, choiceless, and out of that comes the perfume of eternal life.</p>
<p>Liberation has to be achieved by action and through action; whereas, you regard action as having no meaning, that action is merely a stepping stone to reward. It is not through action that liberation is realized but in action itself. I hope you see the signification of this. We are kind because we want to come to a righteous understanding. Such a kindness has no value. Likewise, we say we will be righteous, but if we will be righteous to obtain liberation, that is but merchandise.</p>
<p>Hence, your action is always based on fear, reward or punishment, and the significance of the action is lost. So love has no meaning; tenderness, thoughts, affection, none of these have a meaning. You are concerned with achieving liberation, which is a mere idea. It is but an idea, and therefore false, and you cannot understand liberation if you are looking all the time from a point of view of time: today, yesterday, tomorrow, what did I do yesterday, and what shall I do tomorrow? You ask, “Is liberation a gradual thing?” It is not, because there is no time. I will put it differently. Consistency is time, and you can only understand liberation when your mind is free of time, not if you are comparing what you did yesterday and are going to do tomorrow or today. It is still caught up in the idea of time. Time exists so long as there is incomplete understanding of action, which creates memory. Time exists so long as your action is not complete, either influenced externally or in imitation of a standard which creates conflict. Out of that memory the mind gets identified, and hence the question, “Is liberation a gradual process?”</p>
<p>You know, it is like a man who has twisted his ankle. If you untwist it, then life flows freely, without pain, without subjective consciousness. Likewise, if your mind and heart are free from all hindrances that create conflict, pain, and struggle, then there is a flow of eternal life. Your search after liberation itself is a hindrance, because your search is after something you must already know, and you cannot know if you are in prison, if you are in pain, in conflict. So you can’t seek <i>that which is,</i> but you can free yourself from that which holds you - through comprehending, not through conquering.</p>
<p>To me, perfection, liberation, or eternal reality is not to be gained on a scale of experience, what you call progress. It does not lie at the ultimate height of all experience. But if you are fully awake, if your attention is given at the right moment when you are extremely sensitive, then you will understand the significance of experience and the whole substance of life.</p>
<p>We think liberation or the idea of God or truth or perfection is a matter of occupation. Yesterday I was that, today I am this, tomorrow I shall be something else. Or, yesterday I have changed, today I will change - all with regard to a certain pattern, a certain standard. You have established that standard, and you are molding yourself according to that. Surely, that is no liberation; that is a glorified form of prejudice. Whereas, perfection comes, or is, when the mind is free from all standards, from all comparison, when the mind discerns immediately. And you can only discern, as I said, truly, lastingly, when you have discovered true values. No one can give you true values, and you will only discover them when you are in crisis, when your whole life is in a crisis. It is not necessary to strain after it, i.e. have a crisis every second of the day, until the mind is free from all crises, from all problems. Before that, you cannot understand the everlasting; you can only understand when the mind is free from choice.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>How about the person who has no conflicts, but who is also lazy, inert. Does he not have to discipline himself, make himself do something, in order to understand?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Surely, the lazy person has his own reward. Why should he be lazy? I think, certainly, it is stupid to be lazy, because one does not understand. If you are lazy and it gives you satisfaction and contentment like a cow, what harm is there? If you are satisfied, if you are content, you may be lazy. But unfortunately, there is no such person. He may be lazy, but there is something going on, eating his heart out, and gradually that laziness covers up his pain. So he dies. He is living, though he is dead.</p>
<p>You ask me, “Does he not have to discipline himself?” That is such a false thing. If he wants to be lazy, he does not want to discipline himself in order to be active. You think by discipline, naturally, you will be active, but that is such a false activity; it is like moving a thing from one place to another, which is what most people consider to be action, doing something. Please don’t misunderstand. One must work. I am not for the man who sits quietly with his sure income. One must live, and therefore living is action, and no amount of discipline will awaken him to real action. What will awaken him is the continual conflict with life. It will shake him out of his laziness. What are you to do? You cannot shake him up. You can, if you are a reformer and reform him to a certain mold, which you have done.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You have said that we must not reconcile, nor compromise between your point of view, and our own illusions and the systems of thought we have accepted. You say many things which seem vitally true. I have also heard other teachers, e.g. Dr. Besant, expound ideas which also seem true, and which my experience partly confirms. I do not want to reconcile these different teachings in the sense of forcing them together, but I do not see how various concepts which are true can be without an ultimate and natural plan of synthesis.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You know, we think truth has many aspects, like colored glass, that in all these images there is one light, with different shades covering it. To me, all that, if I may say so, is nonsense. Please don’t think I am dogmatic. That is invented by a mind which wants to be tolerant to other aspects. I am talking of completeness. In completeness, in that fullness, there is no idea of putting two and two together, of compromising, of taking understanding from other teachers, or from myself, and hence this question does not arise at all.</p>
<p>I use the word <i>compromise</i> with regard to certain things, and I explained what they are, and I gave the example of self-discipline. You hear me talking about the futility of self-discipline, and you hear another talking with the same insistence about the lightness of self-discipline. Now you try to combine and produce something new; whereas I say, find out what its intrinsic worth is, without prejudice. You will only be prejudiced as long as you are looking for that prejudice, what you are going to get out of it. I used that word <i>compromise</i> with regard to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>What is the best way in which to maintain the attitude of awareness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am going on to that tomorrow or after tomorrow, or next week, more fully, but I will briefly explain.</p>
<p>First of all, it is not a question of maintaining. Have you ever been in a room with a snake? Your attention, your whole intense concentration is maintained naturally through fear of being bitten. You don’t say, “How am I to maintain my attention?” Awareness is that approach to life with your whole mind and heart in perfect harmony. That only arises when there is a crisis that demands your instant attention, your whole interest.</p>
<p>Now, you are not interested in what I am talking about. Most people are not interested; that is why these questions arise. I know it by your faces and by the questions. If you are interested, intent to find out, not between the opposites, but the significance of things, only at that moment is there awareness. You will find out the answer immediately. I assure you it is awfully simple; don’t make this awareness so complicated. I have heard so many explanations of what to me is a very simple thing, and how complicated it is made year by year because your mind is so burdened with knowledge and you are only talking out of your knowledge, and applying that awareness to that knowledge.</p>
<p>Please forget everything that you have learned, read in books, and approach what I am saying very simply, freshly, frankly. Then you will see that it is utterly simple. There is awareness only when your whole being is awake and questioning - your whole being is mind as well as heart, not merely mind or merely heart - and when you approach everything in that way, then there is no problem or solution or ways of conquering or disciplining. Then you are acting from your whole being, spontaneously, naturally, without conflict, without effort.</p>
