<p>That morning the river was tarnished silver, for it was cloudy and cold.  The leaves were covered with dust, and everywhere there was a thin layer of it - in the room, on the veranda and on the chair.  It was getting colder; it must have snowed heavily in the Himalayas; one could feel the biting wind from the north, even the birds were aware of it.  But the river that morning had a strange movement of its own; it didn't seem to be ruffled by the wind, it seemed almost motionless and had that timeless quality which all waters seem to have.  How beautiful it was!  No wonder people have made it into a sacred river.  You could sit there, on that veranda, and meditatively watch it endlessly.  You weren't day-dreaming; your thoughts weren't in any direction - they were simply absent.</p>
<p>And as you watched the light on that river, somehow you seemed to lose yourself, and as you closed your eyes there was a penetration into a void that was full of blessing.  This was bliss. He came again that morning, with a young man.  He was the monk who had talked about discipline, sacred books and the authority of tradition.  His face was freshly washed, and so were his robes.  The young man seemed rather nervous.  He had come with the monk, who was probably his guru, and was waiting for him to speak first.  He looked at the river but he was thinking of other things.  Presently the sannyasi said:</p>
<p>"I have come again but this time to talk about love and sensuality.  We, who have taken the vow of chastity, have our sensuous problems.  The vow is only a means of resisting our uncontrollable desires.  I am an old man now, and these desires no longer burn me.  Before I took the vows I was married.  My wife died, and I left my home and went through a period of agony, of intolerable biological urges; I fought them night and day.  It was a very difficult time, full of loneliness, frustration, fears of madness, and neurotic outbursts.  Even now I daren't think about it too much. And this young man has come with me because I think he is going through the same problem.  He wants to give up the world and take the vow of poverty and chastity, as I did.  I have been talking to him for many weeks, and I thought it might be worthwhile if we could both talk over this problem with you, this problem of sex and love.  I hope you don't mind if we talk quite frankly."</p>
<p>If we are going to concern ourselves with this matter, first, if we may suggest it, don't start to examine from a position, or an attitude, or a principle, for this will prevent you from exploration. If you are against sex, or if you insist that it is necessary to life, that it is a part of living, any such assumption will prevent real perception.  We should put away any conclusion, and so be free to look, to examine.</p>
<p>There were a few drops of rain now, and the birds had become quiet, for it was going to rain heavily, and the leaves once again would be fresh and green, full of light and colour. There was a smell of rain, and the strange quietness that comes before a storm was on the land.</p>
<p>So we have two problems - love and sex.  The one is an abstract idea, the other is an actual daily biological urge - a fact that exists and cannot be denied.  Let us first find out what love is, not as an abstract idea but what it actually is.  What is it?  Is it merely a sensuous delight, cultivated by thought as pleasure, the remembrance of an experience which has given great delight or sexual enjoyment?  Is it the beauty of a sunset, or the delicate leaf that you touch or see, or the perfume of the flower that you smell?  Is love pleasure, or desire?  Or is it none of these?  Is love to be divided as the sacred and the profane?  Or is it something indivisible, whole, that cannot be broken up by thought?  Does it exist without the object?  Or does it come into being only because of the object?  Is it because you see the face of a woman that love arises in you - love then being sensation, desire, pleasure, to which thought gives continuity?  Or is love a state in you which responds to beauty as tenderness?  Is love something cultivated by thought so that its object becomes important, or is it utterly unrelated to thought and, therefore, independent, free?  Without understanding this word and the meaning behind it we shall be tortured, or become neurotic about sex, or be enslaved by it.</p>
<p>Love is not to be broken up into fragments by thought.  When thought breaks it up into fragments, as impersonal, personal, sensuous, spiritual, my country and your country, my god and your god, then it is no longer love, then it is something entirely different - a product of memory, of propaganda, of convenience, of comfort and so on.</p>
<p>Is sex the product of thought?  Is sex - the pleasure, the delight, the companionship, the tenderness involved in it - is this a remembrance strengthened by thought?  In the sexual act there is self-forgetfulness, self-abandonment, a sense of the non-existence of fear, anxiety, the worries of life. Remembering this state of tenderness and self-forgetfulness, and demanding its repetition, you chew over it, as it were, until the next occasion.  Is this tenderness, or is it merely a recollection of something that is over and which, through repetition, you hope to capture again?  Is not the repetition of something, however pleasurable, a destructive process?</p>
<p>The young man suddenly found his tongue: "Sex is a biological urge, as you yourself have said, and if this is destructive then isn't eating equally destructive, because that also is a biological urge?"</p>
<p>If one eats when one is hungry - that is one thing.  If one is hungry and thought says: "I must have the taste of this or that type of food" - then it is thought, and it is this which is the destructive repetition.</p>
<p>"In sex, how do you know what is the biological urge, like hunger, and what a psychological demand, like greed?" asked the young man.</p>
<p>Why do you divide the biological urge and the psychological demand?  And there is yet another question, a different question altogether - why do you separate sex from seeing the beauty of a mountain or the loveliness of a flower?  Why do you give such tremendous importance to the one and totally neglect the other?</p>
<p>"If sex is something quite different from love, as you seem to say, then is there any necessity at all to do anything about sex?" asked the young man.</p>
<p>We have never said that love and sex are two separate things.  We have said that love is whole, not to be broken up, and thought, by its very nature, is fragmentary.  When thought dominates, obviously there is no love.  Man generally knows - perhaps only knows - the sex of thought, which is the chewing of the cud of pleasure and its repetition.  There- fore we have to ask: Is there any other kind of sex which is not of thought or desire?</p>
<p>The sannyasi had listened to all this with quiet attention.  Now he spoke: "I have resisted it, I have taken a vow against it, because by tradition, by reason, I have seen that one must have energy for the religious dedicated life.  But I now see that this resistance has taken a great deal of energy.  I have spent more time on resisting, and wasted more energy on it, than I have ever wasted on sex itself. So what you have said - that a conflict of any kind is a waste of energy - I now understand.  Conflict and struggle are far more deadening than the seeing of a woman's face, or even perhaps than sex itself."</p>
<p>Is there love without desire, without pleasure?  Is there sex, without desire, without pleasure?  Is there love which is whole, without thought entering into it?  Is sex something of the past, or is it something each time new?  Thought is obviously old, so we are always contrasting the old and the new.  We are asking questions from the old, and we want an answer in terms of the old.  So when we ask: Is there sex without the whole mechanism of thought operating and working, doesn't it mean that we have not stepped out of the old?  We are so conditioned by the old that we do not feel our way into the new.  We said love is whole, and always new - new not as opposed to the old, for that again is the old.  Any assertion that there is sex without desire is utterly valueless, but if you have followed the whole meaning of thought, then perhaps you will come upon the other. If, however, you demand that you must have your pleasure at any price, then love will not exist.</p>
<p>The young man said: "That biological urge you spoke about is precisely such a demand, for though it may be different from thought it engenders thought." "perhaps I can answer my young friend," said the sannyasi, "for I have been through all this.  I have trained myself for years not to look at a woman.  I have ruthlessly controlled the biological demand.  The biological urge does not engender thought; thought captures it, thought utilizes it, thought makes images, pictures out of this urge - and then the urge is a slave to thought.  It is thought which engenders the urge so much of the time.  As I said, I am beginning to see the extraordinary nature of our own deception and dishonesty.  There is a great deal of hypocrisy in us.  We can never see things as they are but must create illusions about them.  What you are telling us, sir, is to look at everything with clear eyes, without the memory of yesterday; you have repeated this so often in your talks.  Then life does not become a problem.  In my old age I am just beginning to realize this."</p>
<p>The young man looked not completely satisfied.  He wanted life according to his terms, according to the formula which he had carefully built.</p>
<p>This is why it is very important to know oneself, not according to any formula or according to any guru.  This constant choiceless awareness ends all illusions and all hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Now it was coming down in torrents, and the air was very still, and there was only the sound of the rain on the roof and on the leaves.</p>
