<p>When there is communion on the same level and at the same time, there is understanding. Listening is an art, whether to a problem or to each other. To commune there must be no prejudice, no fear, no resistance. Deep and full attention is the beginning of understanding. Understanding is instantaneous, ever in the present; it is not the outcome of growth, not of time. When the heart is dry, the mind fills it with words, but this is not understanding. The realization of truth is ever in the now, and not in the morrow. To receive truth the heart must be open, vulnerable. None can give you truth; it must come to you. To receive it, to directly perceive it, there must be no defense, no safeguards, no walls of resistance.</p>
<p>Understanding comes with the awareness of what is. To be aware of what is, of the obvious, of the actual, without interpreting, without translating, is the beginning of wisdom. The truth of what is is passed over when the mind is burdened with prejudice, with belief, is distorted with effort. To understand exactly the actual puts an end to conflict. To be aware of exactly what one is, from moment to moment, brings freedom from conflict and confusion. It is the beginning of wisdom. To understand the actual what is frees thought from the process of time. Time is a destructive process; it creates confusion. The psychological process of becoming breeds time, and time is not the solvent of problems. There can be understanding of what is only when there is no condemnation of, nor identification with, what is. To be aware of the actual is already the beginning of intelligence, but to be unaware and to struggle only breeds habit.</p>
<p>What is is never static; it is ever in movement, ever undergoing modification; and to follow it, a very alert and passive mind is necessary. It must be free from conclusions, from answers, from belief, and from knowledge to follow the swift movement of what is. To know what is, the actual, is to transcend it.</p>
<p>There is confusion and sorrow; there is individual and collective suffering. This misery is everywhere. How are we to grapple with it? How are we to understand it? What is your response to this misery? From your response, you will be able to directly understand your relationship to this mounting confusion. Those who derive benefit from this misery, worldly or psychological, have their peculiar response and action. They want things to continue as they are. Then there are those whose response in the midst of this misery is to protect what they have, seeking security at different levels. There are others whose response is towards legislation, towards reform, towards outward order; or to try to solve this problem according to a system either of the left or of the right; or seek out a leader, a guru, political or religious, to lead them out of this increasing suffering. All these are various methods of escape from the problem itself. Then escapes become far more important than the problem itself; the ideology, the guru, the bank account, the psychological security become far more important than sorrow itself; then the leader, the authority, is far more significant than misery itself; then organization, rituals assume dominating importance. These become all-important, and not the misery of men. When ideologies and their authorities - either of the right or of the left, religious or secular - assume power, humanity, you, are sacrificed.</p>
<p>What is the cause of this mounting confusion and sorrow, inwardly and outwardly? You have to discover the cause and not merely repeat the authorities of the right or of the left. You must know the truth of it and not repeat the assertions of others, however wise and learned. In discovering for yourself the truth of the cause of sorrow, there is freedom from sorrow; truth liberates and mere repetition is ignorance. It is important to understand this - that truth liberates and you must discover it. When sensate values predominate, there is confusion; there is sorrow when the values of the mind dominate eternal values; there is confusion when the fabrications of the mind fill the heart. When things made by the hand or by the mind assume supreme importance, then there is conflict, confusion, and sorrow. When the value of things dominates, then belief and ideology possess significant influence. From this confusion we try to escape, and the very search for the real becomes a flight from what is. He who seeks, struggles to find truth, can never find it; but in understanding what is, truth comes into being. To understand, there must be still, silent observation and alert, passive awareness.</p>
<p>Destruction is keeping pace with existence. Frustration follows action; the wave of confusion is ever covering our life; death is ever our companion. Some have freed themselves from confusion and sorrow, but confusion and sorrow continue. Each one must free himself from this confusion and sorrow, and then only can there be happiness and peace in the world. This freedom is not to be found tomorrow, but in the now. Time does not bring understanding; understanding is ever in the present. You must free yourself from misery now and not wait for tomorrow. To wait for tomorrow is to be caught in the wave of death and confusion. If you postpone, you are caught in the wave of strife and misery. You must perceive the truth now, for truth is the liberator and not your effort, not your craving for freedom, for happiness.</p>
<p>Truth must be perceived now and not be postponed; in postponing you give birth to confusion. Truth alone can bring about creative revolution, the revolution of renewal. Change is a modified continuation; the revolution of the left is the continuation of the right. But this creative revolution is not a modified change, but the abandonment of change altogether. While thought is changing, moving from the known to the known, there cannot be renewal. This revolution can only take place in the individual. Individuality comes into being in relationship. This relationship creates society. Society is not a separate entity, existing by itself: it is the outward projection of the inner relationship between man and man. The mere change of the outer has little significance without a fundamental transformation in the psychological activities.</p>
<p>Without self-knowledge, there is no foundation for right thinking and action. No system can transplant self-knowledge, the knowledge of the ways of the mind and heart. Systems can and do modify and change the outer activity of man, but man always transforms the system according to his inner demands. Until I in my relationship with you understand and thereby bring about fundamental transformation, I am the cause of conflict and confusion, destruction and misery, exploitation and ruthlessness. This understanding does not lie in the future, but always in the present. If you look for it in the future, tomorrow, then you are caught in the wave of confusion and death.</p>
<p>When there is absorbing interest there is immediate understanding and action. If there is no psychological transformation now, it will not come tomorrow, in the future. Change, modified continuity, will take place with tomorrow, but it is not fundamental transformation. This transformation can take place only now and not in duration, in time. So how can you, who are the result of the past, your thought founded on the past, on yesterday, on time, step out of time? Time ceases when there is complete understanding. This timeless being is not an illusion, a self-induced hallucination. When a problem is completely understood it leaves no residue, memory; memory is time. The self, the continuation of memory, breeds time, the ever- accumulating past. The freedom from the self takes place only when each problem, as it arises, is completely and deeply understood.</p>
<p>Questioner: I am born with a certain temperament, a certain psychological and physical pattern, whatever may be its reason. This pattern becomes the major single factor in my life. It dominates me absolutely. My freedom within the pattern is very limited, the majority of my reactions and impulses being rigidly predetermined. Can I break away from the tyranny of genetic factors?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Each one of us is the result of his father and mother who in turn were the product of their parents. Their beliefs, their hopes and fears, their craving for security, their gods and their temples, their knowledge and their superstition, their envy and ambition is the structure of society, the environment in which each one is held. He is a part of the environment; he is the result of the past in conjunction with the present. He is held in a psychological and environmental influence. The son is the father, modified. Existence is the product of the past through the present to the future. It is the outcome of time. You are the result of yesterday, modified by today, giving birth to tomorrow. Now, the questioner asks, can he step out of time? Can he break away from the pattern of the past?</p>
<p>When what is is interpreted, then thought slips into the unreal, into theory, into speculation and credulity. To understand what is is arduous. What is it that conditions you? What is it that limits thought? What is it that creates the pattern in which thought is caught? Is it not thought itself? If thought ceases, the pattern is broken. Thought is the outcome of yesterday, of the past; it responds to every challenge, which is ever new, according to the pattern of yesterday. Can thought free itself from the burden of yesterday? Only when thinking, as we know it, ceases. This cessation of thought is not an escape from thought.</p>
<p>You seem puzzled; you are waiting for an answer from me for this question. But the answer is in the question itself. In understanding what is, the problem itself, the solution is found. The very problem holds its own solution. If you look to the answer, then the problem is not understood; but in studying the problem itself, without the anxious search for the answer, the problem ceases. If you look for an answer you will find it; but it will be according to your convenience, to your gratification.</p>
<p>So the problem is this: thought is conditioned, fixed in a pattern. Thought responds to challenge, which is ever new, according to the past, thus modifying the new. Thought, which is the product of yesterday, can only respond in terms of yesterday, of time. When you ask, ''How can I break away from the tyranny of conditioning?'' you are asking a wrong question. Thought can never be free; thought only knows continuity, not freedom. Freedom is when thought is not. There is freedom only when the process of continuity ceases; thought gives continuity. So thought must be aware of its own conditioning and not try to become something. The becoming gives continuity to thought and thus there is no freedom from conditioning. Thought must cease for freedom to be. When thought is active, positively or negatively, then it is conditioning, giving birth to modified continuity.</p>
<p>Can thinking cease? What is thinking? The so-called thinking is the response of memory. Memory is the residue of experience. When there is a challenge, thought, which is the result of yesterday, responds. Challenge, which is ever new, is met with the old, and so the new is not completely understood. This incompleteness of an experience leaves a mark which we call memory. Have you not noticed that when you understand an experience completely that there is no memory of it? It is only an incomplete act that leaves a mark. The response of memory is called thinking. Can there be a state in which memory is not functioning? When time ceases, there is such a state which alone transforms, which alone is creative.</p>
