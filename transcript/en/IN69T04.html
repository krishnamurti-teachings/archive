<p>Meditation is the unfolding of the new.  The new is beyond and above the repetitious past - and meditation is the ending of this repetition.  The death that meditation brings about is the immortality of the new.  The new is not within the area of thought, and meditation is the silence of thought.</p>
<p>Meditation is not an achievement, nor is it the capture of a vision, nor the excitement of sensation.  It is like the river, not to be tamed, swiftly running and overflowing its banks.  It is the music without sound; it cannot be domesticated and made use of.  It is the silence in which the observer has ceased from the very beginning.</p>
<p>The sun wasn't up yet; you could see the morning star through the trees.  There was a silence that was really extraordinary.  Not the silence between two noises or between two notes, but the silence that has no reason whatsoever - the silence that must have been at the beginning of the world.  It filled the whole valley and the hills.</p>
<p>The two big owls, calling to each other, never disturbed that silence, and a distant dog barking at the late moon was part of this immensity.  The dew was especially heavy, and as the sun came up over the hill it was sparkling with many colours and with the glow that comes with the sun's first rays.</p>
<p>The delicate leaves of the jacaranda were heavy with dew, and birds came to have their morning baths, fluttering their wings so that the dew on those delicate leaves filled their feathers. The crows were particularly persistent; they would hop from one branch to another, pushing their heads through the leaves, fluttering their wings and preening themselves.  There were about half-a-dozen of them on that one heavy branch, and there were many other birds, scattered all over the tree, taking their morning bath.</p>
<p>And this silence spread, and seemed to go beyond the hills. There were the usual noises of children shouting, and laughter; and the farm began to wake up.</p>
<p>It was going to be a cool day, and now the hills were taking on the light of the sun.  They were very old hills - probably the oldest in the world - with oddly shaped rocks that seemed to be carved out with great care, balanced one on top of the other; but no wind or touch could loosen them from this balance.</p>
<p>It was a valley far removed from towns, and the road through it led to another village.  The road was rough and there were no cars or buses to disturb the ancient quietness of this valley.  There were bullock carts, but their movement was a part of the hills.  There was a dry river bed that only flowed with water after heavy rains, and the colour was a mixture of red, yellow and brown; and it, too, seemed to move with the hills.  And the villagers who walked silently by were like the rocks.</p>
<p>The day wore on and towards the end of the evening, as the sun was setting over the western hills, the silence came in from afar, over the hills, through the trees, covering the little bushes and the ancient banyan.  And as the stars became brilliant, so the silence grew into great intensity; you could hardly bear it.</p>
<p>The little lamps of the village were put out, and with sleep the intensity of that silence grew deeper, wider and incredibly overpowering.  Even the hills became more quiet, for they, too, had stopped their whisperings, their movement, and seemed to lose their immense weight.</p>
<p>She said she was forty-five; she was carefully dressed in a sari, with some bangles on her wrists.  The older man with her said he was her uncle.  We all sat on the floor overlooking a big garden with a banyan tree, a few mango trees, the bright bougainvillaea and the growing palms.  She was terribly sad.  Her hands were restless and she was trying to prevent herself from bursting into speech and perhaps tears.  The uncle said: "We have come to talk to you about my niece.  Her husband died a few years ago, and then her son, and now she can't stop crying and has aged terribly.  We don't know what to do.  The usual doctors' advice doesn't seem to work, and she seems to be losing contact with her other children.  She's getting thinner. We don't know where all this is going to end, and she insisted that we should come to see you."</p>
<p>"l lost my husband four years ago.  He was a doctor and died of cancer.  He must have hidden it from me, and only in the last year or so did I know about it.  He was in agony although the doctors gave him morphine and other sedatives.  Before my eyes he withered away and was gone."</p>
<p>She stopped, almost choking with tears.  There was a dove sitting on the branch, quietly cooing.  It was brownish-grey, with a small head and a large body - not too large, for it was a dove.  Presently it flew off and the branch was swinging up and down from the pressure of its flight.</p>
<p>"I somehow cannot bear this loneliness, this meaningless existence without him.  I loved my children; I had three of them, a boy and two girls.  One day last year the boy wrote to me from school that he was not feeling well, and a few days later I got a telephone call from the headmaster, saying that he was dead."</p>
<p>Here she began to sob uncontrollably.  Presently she produced a letter from the boy in which he had said that he wanted to come home for he was not feeling well, and that he hoped she was all right. She explained that he had been concerned about her; he hadn't wanted to go to school but had wanted to remain with her.  And she more or less forced him to go, afraid that he would be affected by her grief. Now it was too late.  The two girls, she said, were not fully aware of all that had happened for they were quite young.  Suddenly she burst out: "I don't know what to do.  This death has shaken the very foundations of my life.  Like a house, our marriage was carefully built on what we considered a deep foundation.  Now everything is destroyed by this enormous event."</p>
<p>The uncle must have been a believer, a traditionalist, for he added: "God has visited this on her.  She has been through all the necessary ceremonies but they have not helped her.  I believe in reincarnation, but she takes no comfort in it.  She doesn't even want to talk about it.  To her it is all meaningless and we have not been able to give her any comfort."</p>
<p>We sat there in silence for some time.  Her handkerchief was now quite wet; a clean handkerchief from the drawer helped to wipe away the tears on her cheeks.  The red bougainvillaea was peeping through the window, and the bright southern light was on every leaf.</p>
<p>Do you want to talk about this seriously - go to the root of it all?  Or do you want to be comforted by some explanation, by some reasoned argument, and be distracted from your sorrow by some satisfying words?</p>
<p>She replied: "I'd like to go into it deeply, but I don't know whether I have the capacity or the energy to face what you are going to say.  When my husband was alive we used to come to some of your talks; but now I may find it very difficult to go along with you."</p>
<p>Why are you in sorrow?  Don't give an explanation, for that will only be a verbal construction of your feeling, which will not be the actual fact.  So, when we ask a question, please don't answer it. Just listen, and find out for yourself.  Why is there this sorrow of death - in every house, rich and poor, from the most powerful in the land to the beggar?  Why are you in sorrow?  Is it for your husband - or is it for yourself?  If you are crying for him, can your tears help him?  He has gone irrevocably.  Do what you will, you will never have him back.  No tears, no belief, no ceremonies or gods can ever bring him back.  It is a fact which you have to accept; you can't do anything about it.  But if you are crying for yourself, because of your loneliness, your empty life, because of the sensual pleasures you had and the companionship, then you are crying, aren't you, out of your own emptiness and out of self-pity?  Perhaps for the first time you are aware of your own inward poverty.  You have invested in your husband, haven't you, if we may gently point it out, and it has given you comfort, satisfaction and pleasure?  All you are feeling now - the sense of loss, the agony of loneliness and anxiety - is a form of self-pity, isn't it?  Do look at it.  Don't harden your heart against it and say: "I love my husband, and I wasn't thinking a bit about myself.  I wanted to protect him, even though I often tried to dominate him; but it was all for his sake and there was never a thought for myself." Now that he has gone you are realizing, aren't you, your own actual state?  His death has shaken you and shown you the actual state of your mind and heart.  You may not be willing to look at it; you may reject it out of fear, but if you observe a little more you will see that you are crying out of your own loneliness, out of your inward poverty - which is, out of self-pity.</p>
<p>"You are rather cruel, aren't you, sir?" she said.  "I have come to you for real comfort, and what are you giving me?"</p>
<p>It is one of the illusions most people have - that there is such a thing as inward comfort; that somebody else can give it to you or that you can find it for yourself.  I am afraid there is no such thing.  If you are seeking comfort you are bound to live in illusion, and when that illusion is broken you become sad because the comfort is taken away from you.  So, to understand sorrow or to go beyond it, one must see actually what is inwardly taking place, and not cover it up.  To point out all this is not cruelty, is it?  It's not something ugly from which to shy away.  When you see all this, very clearly, then you come out of it immediately, without a scratch, unblemished, fresh, untouched by the events of life.  death is inevitable for all of us; one cannot escape from it.  We try to find every kind of explanation, cling to every kind of belief in the hope of going beyond it, but do what you will it is always there; tomorrow, or round the corner, or many years away - it is always there.  One has to come into touch with this enormous fact of life.</p>
<p>"But..." said the uncle, and out came the traditional belief in Atman, the soul, the permanent entity which continues.  He was on his own ground now, well-trodden with cunning arguments and quotations. You saw him suddenly sit up straight and the light of battle, the battle of words, came into his eyes.  Sympathy, love and understanding were gone.  He was on his sacred ground of belief, of tradition, trodden down by the heavy weight of conditioning: "But the Atman is in every one of us!  It is reborn and continues until it realizes that it is Brahman.  We must go through sorrow to come to that reality.  We live in illusion; the world is an illusion.  There is only one reality." And he was off!  She looked at me, not paying much attention to him, and a gentle smile began to appear on her face; and we both looked at the dove which had come back, and the bright red bougainvillaea.</p>
<p>There is nothing permanent either on earth or in ourselves. Thought can give continuity to something it thinks about; it can give permanency to a word, to an idea, to a tradition.  Thought thinks itself permanent, but is it permanent?  Thought is the response of memory, and is that memory permanent?  It can build an image and give to that image a continuity, a permanency, calling it Atman or whatever you like, and it can remember the face of the husband or the wife and hold on to it.  All this is the activity of thought which creates fear, and out of this fear there is the drive for permanency - the fear of not having a meal tomorrow, or shelter - the fear of death.  This fear is the result of thought, and Brahman is the product of thought, too.</p>
<p>The uncle said: "Memory and thought are like a candle.  You put it out and re-light it again; you forget, and you remember again later on.  You die and are reborn again into another life.  The flame of the candle is the same - and not the same.  So in the flame there is a certain quality of continuity."</p>
<p>But the flame which has been put out is not the same flame as the new.  There is an ending of the old for the new to be.  If there is a constant modified continuity, then there is no new thing at all.  The thousand yesterdays cannot be made new; even a candle burns itself out.  Everything must end for the new to be.</p>
<p>The uncle now cannot rely on quotations or beliefs or on the sayings of others, so he withdraws into himself and becomes quiet, puzzled and rather angry, for he has been exposed to himself, and, like his niece, doesn't want to face the fact. "I am not concerned about all this," she said.  "I am utterly miserable.  I have lost my husband and my son, and there are these two children left.  What am I to do?"</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the two children, you can't be concerned about yourself and your misery.  You have to look after them, educate them rightly, bring them up without the usual mediocrity.  But if you are consumed by your own self-pity, which you call "the love for your husband", and if you withdraw into isolation, then you are also destroying the other two children.  Consciously or unconsciously we are all utterly selfish, and so long as we get what we want we consider everything is all right.  But the moment an event takes place to shatter all this, we cry out in despair, hoping to find other comforts which, of course, will again be shattered.  So this process goes on, and if you want to be caught in it, knowing full well all the implications of it, then go ahead.  But if you see the absurdity of it all, then you will naturally stop crying, stop isolating yourself, and live with the children with a new light and with a smile on your face.</p>
