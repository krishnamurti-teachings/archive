<p>A lovely morning! Did you notice the blue sky? How extremely limpid it is, clear, very quiet! Did you notice the river this morning? There was no ruffle on it, and the sun early in the morning, how peaceful it was! You know, that is the kind of thing that we all want - and not only the people who live on the riverside - this extraordinary peace. When we have it, we do not know that we have it. That is the strange part of it. Those fishermen living in that village, they also do not know. They have all that beauty, that quietness, that sense of being alone with nature, but they are not satisfied because they are hungry. They have to struggle for life, so in spite of this extraordinary beauty and quietness, there is a constant battle going on. They want more money, their children are ill, their wives, their husbands, or mothers are dying, and so, in spite of this tranquillity, there is a great deal of disturbance. It is so with most of us, too.</p>
<p>When we are young, we are not concerned with peace, with tranquillity, with beauty; we only want to enjoy ourselves, to have a good time, to play about. Then as we grow older, we want so many things; we want to be happy, we want to have virtue, we want children, we compete with each other for a better job, we want to have a position where there is more power, and so on. But underneath all that, we want to be left alone, we do not want to be disturbed; we want our thoughts to run in easy grooves, and so we set up habits of easy thought, easy existence, have a comfortable job and there stagnate. So most of us, as we grow older, want to be left alone, we do not want to be disturbed, and this state of nondisturbance is what we call peace. For most of us, that is peace - having a clear sky. But in this apparently clear sky there are a great many things going on, a great disturbance in the atmosphere, which we do not see. What we see is very superficial, is just on the surface. The kind of tranquillity we want is a superficial calm, an easy existence, and that we call peace. But peace is not so easy to come by. We can only understand peace when we understand the great disturbance, the discontent in which each one of us is caught, when the mind is free from easy thought, easy grooves of patterns of action, when we are really disturbed - which we all avoid.</p>
<p>We do not want to be disturbed; we want things to remain as they are. If you are in a comfortable position, if you own a good house or car, you do not want to be disturbed; you want to let things remain. But there is disturbance going on all the time, around you and in you. There is social disturbance - so you become a reactionary, a conservative, you want to let things remain, you are constantly avoiding any form of change and are always going back to the good old days when things were as they were. While we are young, we are disturbed, we question, we are curious, we want to know. As we grow older, we want not to be disturbed, we do not want to find out the answers. Our religion is merely a solace to us, it gives us peace, gives us tranquillity, gives us the hope, ''We shall be better off next life.'' We accept things as they are. When we talk about peace it is a state, for most of us, in which there is no disturbance of any kind. We imagine, we meditate on that peace as a state in which there is no kind of disturbance, no kind of revolution, no kind of deep radical change. So, our minds become very dull, lethargic, dead; what we call peace is death. But I think there is another kind of peace; a peace that is much more difficult to understand, a peace which is not a reaction, not just an opposite of conflict. Do you understand what I am talking about? - that peace in which there is no conflict. Now we only know the opposites, the dual process - I was happy yesterday and I am unhappy today, and I would like to get back to that happiness tomorrow. We keep these opposites going on, working, struggling, and when we have a moment which we call happiness as opposed to unhappiness, we want to remain in that state. Remaining in that state is what we call peace, happiness, constant security. That is all we know, and we are always asking, ''How am I to get back to that state in which I was happy, in which I was secure?'' But I do not think that is peace.</p>
<p>Peace is not something which is an opposite to conflict. It is not the outcome of struggle, of pain, of suffering, of unhappiness. If it is, then it is not peace - it is just the opposite reaction to what is. This is a bit difficult, so please ask your teachers about it because it is very important to understand this. Peace is like freedom. Freedom is the love of a thing for itself, it is not just the opposite of slavery. The love of something is not for what it will bring you - position, prestige, money, fame, notoriety, or what you will. It is something in itself, without a reward, without being afraid of punishment or failure, or hoping for success. So, also, is this thing called peace not the opposite of conflict, disturbance, revolution.</p>
<p>To understand this peace which is not an opposite, we must understand the conflicts of the mind. Being disturbed, the mind wants peace, it wants to be left alone, not to be disturbed. So, it creates a haven, a belief, a refuge, which it calls ''peace.'' But that is not peace; it is only a reaction, a movement away from ''this'' to ''that.'' But life does not leave you alone. Life is very disturbed - life being the poor people, the rich people, the camel that suffers with so much weight on its back, the politicians, the revolutions, the wars, the quarrels, the bitterness, the unhappiness, the joy, and the dark shadows. The whole of that life is very disturbed, and since we do not understand it, we want to run away; we sit on the banks of the river, close our eyes and think about something which we call peace. That is merely an escape, a reaction, an opposite to the state of disturbance. But, if we can understand all these disturbances of living - the joy, the unhappiness, the struggles, the jealousies, the envies - if we can understand all that, not run away from it, just look at what is without condemning, just understand what is, then out of that there will be the peace which is not an opposite. In that peace there is great depth, a totally different activity which is creativeness, which is God, which is truth. But one cannot come to it or understand it if one does not understand the disturbances. In understanding these disturbances, these discontents, these constant inquiries, perplexities, anxieties, the mind becomes very clear. Peace is not something apart from the mind, but it comes when I understand all the difficulties. To understand the difficulties, I must not condemn them, I must not compare one difficulty with another. I must not say, ''I suffer much more! You suffer less.'' Suffering is suffering - you do not suffer more and I less, or I more and you less. If we can know suffering without comparison, we shall understand it. Out of that understanding, the mind becomes very simple, very clear, very innocent, and it is this innocence that is peace. The mind that goes through experience, understands the experience, and does not store it up, is innocent and it knows peace.</p>
<p>It is rather complex for a young student to understand all this, but you should know about all these things because you will be going out of this place into a world where there is frightful competition, where everyone is out for himself - for his own family, his own country, his own God. If we do not understand this process, we will be caught in it, we will be driven along by society, by circumstances. It is very important, while we are young, to be educated - or to educate ourselves - so clearly, so simply, that we can understand the battle of life. But the difficulty is that we spend our days in things that do not really matter. Have you noticed how you spend your day as a student? Mostly in the classroom, a few hours of play, go to bed exhausted, wake up, and then begin again. You never spend an hour or even ten minutes a day talking about these things that really do matter. Neither the educator nor those who are being educated spend any of their time going into these matters, finding out the truth of them and discovering how to improve life. That is far more important than passing an examination. Thousands pass examinations all over the world, but they do not mature. Life is a process of learning all the time, understanding continuously. There is no end to understanding; you cannot say, ''I have finished my examinations, I will throw away my books, I am ready for life.'' But this is what we generally do. We never pick up the books again after we have passed the examinations.</p>
<p>If we can read rightly, then the books have much to tell. But there is something far deeper than books; that is ourselves. If we know how to read the thing that we are in ourselves, there is immeasurable richness. Then you do not have to read a single book. It is all there, in ourselves. But it requires a much greater capacity than reading a book. None of you is helped in reading the thing that you are, you never spend time every day in coming to it and understanding it; you are bored with it. You are tired when the real things are mentioned. Most of us do not want to be disturbed; outwardly we have jobs, we have occupations, we are teachers, and so on; we carry on, and the beauty of life passes by.</p>
<p>Questioner: How can we progress in this world?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: Does progress in this world consist mainly in being somebody socially or climbing the ladder of success? Why do we want to progress in this world? Why do we want to become more clever, more learned, more powerful? More money, a bigger house, means to us progress; that is why we all want more. We all want to keep on climbing, don't we, not only in this world but spiritually, inwardly. We have to see the truth of this thing, that this so-called progress, outward or inward, does not bring tranquillity and peace but only leads to wars, to destruction, to greater misery. We do not understand ourselves, the ways of our own existence, and so we are enamored of this progress - the progress of the airplane, the very latest car, the astonishing things the inventors are producing. These things have their own uses, but unless we change ourselves, we use these things in a manner which causes destruction and misery.</p>
<p>Questioner: At every meeting, you tell us to have a discussion with the teachers for at least ten minutes in the morning, but many of our teachers do not come to the meetings. So what are we to do in order to have a discussion?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: If most of them do not come to the meetings, ask the others who do come. When you attend the class, you must have a teacher there. Why don't you ask him? Why don't you say, ''Please, before we start our classes, let us talk about what was said at the morning meeting.'' But, I think the question is a little more difficult. Because, the teachers, when you ask them to discuss with you before the classes begin, get rather annoyed, don't they? They do not want to be questioned about these matters because they do not quite understand. They do not want to feel that they do not understand. They are teachers, you know, they are superior people, and you are only the students. So they want to keep you in your place. You, being impudent, want to catch them out. So it works both ways, does it not?</p>
<p>I think it is important for the teachers as well as for the students to listen to these talks and to discuss them together. What I am talking about is life; this is not just a fancy, a belief, a religion, a sect. This is life, and if the teachers do not understand it, then naturally they cannot help the students to understand. If the students want to discuss with them, why should they get angry or annoyed or disturbed? If they begin to think, they also will see the problems; then they will find a way of talking about them. But unfortunately, most of our teachers are not interested in all this. They have their own problems, they have their jobs, they are well-established, and they want you to leave them alone. The young mind, the mind of the student, wants to know, to find out, to inquire, to disturb the teacher. That is why you, the older people, should pay attention to what is being said because, in your hands, a new generation can come into being. If you are not interested in all these things, you are going to produce a generation as cursed as your own. You are really producing a curse on the land if you insist on educating your children according to your own pattern. The pattern of the older generation is nothing to be proud of. It is really important that the older people, the teachers, should inquire into all this.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is self-confidence and how does it come into being in man?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: Sir, you dig a hole in the garden, manure it, water it, and then put a plant in and watch it grow. You feel that you can at least do something, don't you? So you dig another hole, plant another tree, and that gives you a sense that you can do things, that gives you a confidence, as when you pass examinations one after the other. The capacity to do anything, to plant, to drive a car, to write a book, to pass examinations, gives you a sense of confidence, does it not? When you write a poem without effort, often you say, ''By Jove! I can do it very easily.'' It gives you a sense of confidence. But, what happens? That confidence becomes a way of self-importance, ''I can do things.'' So, when you use your capacity, you begin to have self-importance. That is, if I am able to speak well on a platform, which may be my sole capacity, I use the platform for my importance, as a means of expanding myself. Or I may be able to perform some dance, and that gives me enormous self-importance because I show myself off. So, I use capacity as a means of giving strength to my subtle, inward forms of selfishness.</p>
<p>What is important is to have the capacity to do things without the strengthening of the self. You understand? When you write a poem, when you plant a tree, do not say, ''I have written a poem, I have planted a tree.'' It requires a great deal of intelligence to see that and to stop using capacity - however great or little it may be - for self-expansion, for making oneself important.</p>
<p>Questioner: As a boy grows, he becomes curious about sex. Why is it so?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: It is a natural thing. Are you not curious about how trees grow? Have you not seen that the cows have calves? Everything is curious. How a little plant grows, becomes a tree, and produces fruit - is that not astonishing? Please listen carefully. We do not use this interest to find out in every direction. You understand? You never inquire why a tree grows, why a bird flies. You never see the beauty of the bird and the shades of the tree. You never dig in the garden, and you never plant a tree, a bush; you never smell a flower, you never breathe the air with enjoyment; you never create anything with your own hands. Because you are not interested in all these things creatively, you become interested in one thing which you call sex, but if you are interested in all these things, then that also is a part of your life, that also is a natural thing. It is nature's way of producing babies, there is nothing wrong about it, but that should not become our occupation; our mind should not be completely concentrated on that, as most of our minds are.</p>
<p>When we are young, if we have not taken interest in the flowers, in the rivers, in the fish, in creating something with our hands, then that thing, sex, becomes more important. If we can be creatively interested in everything - in painting, in music, to play an instrument, to write a poem, to play games, to eat right food, to put on the right clothes, to see the sky of an evening and early morning, see the beauty of the trees, our mind taking in all that, creatively enjoying, seeing the beauty of it all, which is, after all, education - then sex is not an ugly problem. But because we have not been encouraged to look at all these things creatively, this thing sex becomes a nightmare.</p>
<p>I do hope the elder people are listening. After all, that is education - to help the students to plant trees and care for them, to let them make things with their hands, milk the cows, go for walks - not always everlastingly playing games. To look at the trees, the birds, the skies, to widen the mind creatively, extensively - that is education, not the passing of some stupid and silly examinations.</p>
<p>Questioner: When we see girls we try to show ourselves off. Why is it?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: I have answered that question. We are attracted to what we call the opposite sex, the opposite person, the girl; that is a normal thing, not to be ashamed of, not to be condemned. When you see a tree, are you not attracted by the tree? When you see a lovely bird - that kingfisher, blue and marvelous in flight - are you not delighted by it? Perhaps you are not because you never look. Last night, there was thunder, lightning, rain. You never looked, did you? You never felt the rain on your face. To see everybody running for shelter, to see how the roads are washed clean and how the leaves are brighter - this also is an attraction.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are all girls or boys or grown-ups, insensitive to everything in life except to that one thing, and that becomes an enormous problem afterwards in our life, a problem with which we struggle. We have to be sensitive to everything about us, to those wretched bullocks that are drawing the heavy carts day after day - how thin they are, and how tired the drivers look! - the poor villagers, the disease, the empty stomachs. To be aware of all this is part of education. If you are sensitive to all these things, then you will not want to show off.</p>
<p>Beauty is something only sensitive minds and hearts can find. Mere attraction, mere sensation, though it may be pleasurable at the beginning, does not completely satisfy, so there is pain in it. But if the mind can look at all the things of life, all the depths and heights and qualities of it, if the mind can be sensitive to them, then the attraction of boy and girl has its right place, but without the other, this becomes a very shallow petty affair.</p>
<p>Questioner: How can we create the feeling of the necessity of manual work?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURT I: How can we feel that manual work is important? Sir, when you have to do things yourself, the question does not arise. The question arises when somebody else sweeps the floor instead of you. When you have your own physical work to do, day after day, you do not put that question. The villager digging, plowing, does not say, ''How can I make manual labor important?'' He has to do it. But we are thankful that we have not got to do manual labor. We, the upper middle class, have withdrawn from all manual labor because we have a little money; and we have the tradition of centuries that the educated men, the Brahmins, the upper class people, have nothing to do with the squalid affair of manual labor. If you live in America, you have to do everything yourself - wash the floors, do the laundry, cook, wash dishes - because there are no servants. There, only the very, very rich can afford servants. They are not called servants, they are called helpers, and they are treated like human beings. But, in this country you have overpopulation and there are thousands for one job. If you have a little money, you employ somebody to do the dirty job, and you gradually withdraw from doing anything with your hands. If you see that, and if you see the importance of doing something with your hands, then you will naturally do it. The mentality of the so-called educated people, whether they are clerks or high officials, is the same - mediocre, petty, small.</p>
<p>Those people who refuse to touch the earth, to tend the flowers, do not know what they miss. If you really dig into the garden and plant, see things grow, milk a cow, look after chickens, then something happens to you, there is an astonishing richness in it. Those who have no touch with the earth miss a great deal. Try to have a garden of your own, plant a tree of your own, do it, organize it; then you will see what will happen to you inwardly. It gives you a sense of release, beauty, the love of the earth, of the little worms inside the earth. But unfortunately, we do not know that feeling, nor do we know the feeling of sitting still and actually looking at something. We know none of these inward riches, and not knowing, we acquire superficial, transient riches.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is the sun?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: Have you asked your teacher? The sun is, according to scientists, a ball of fire, and it gives you heat, light, strength, everything. Why don't you ask your teachers about it?</p>
<p>Questioner: How can one be satisfied with what one is?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: The thing is very simple if you listen to what I am saying. Please listen carefully. Dissatisfaction comes when there is comparison. When you see somebody else having more and you having less, and you compare yourself with that other person, then dissatisfaction comes, but if you do not compare, then there is no problem. But not to compare requires a great deal of interest and understanding because all our education, all our training is based on comparison: ''That boy is not as good as you,'' ''You are not so clever as that boy,'' and so on. Then you struggle, and the other boy struggles also. So we keep up this game of constant comparison and struggle. But if you love the thing which you are doing, you do it because you love it, and not because somebody else is doing it better than you, or you are doing it better than somebody else. When you make no comparison of any kind, then the thing that you are doing, that itself, begins to produce its own depths, its own heights.</p>
<p>Questioner: Why can't we see the sun?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: Because it is too bright. You cannot look at an electric lamp if it is a powerful lamp. The eyes are too sensitive.</p>
