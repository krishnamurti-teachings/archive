<p>Krishnamurti: This morning, if we may, we are going to have a conversation, talk over things together in a form of dialogue, to discuss, not opinions, not some kind of conclusions that you have come to, but rather go into the problems that one has, whether they are superficial or deep, and really see if we cannot radically bring about a psychological revolution in ourselves. I think it would be worthwhile and it would be also both interesting and quite fun if we could do this together. So what shall we begin with? What shall we talk over together, like two friends, who have got the same common problem, using the same common words, without any distortion of words, without any ulterior motive, if we could so talk over things together, I think it would be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Questioner: Could we hear more of the nature of awareness? The way you speak of it almost seems to be so pointed and direct that it is like a concentration exercise. I am sure that is wrong.</p>
<p>K: Would you like to discuss that? Would you like to talk over this question of awareness?</p>
<p>Q: Mr Krishnamurti, may I briefly ask you something which is a very, very common problem. A woman I know well, she is in her fifties, her husband has died of cancer, very, very painful to have cancer, very unhappy about. She keeps on ringing up and saying, 'Oh I am so unhappy.'</p>
<p>K: Yes, so you want to discuss...</p>
<p>Q: Can you say something, I want to say something to cheer her up.</p>
<p>K: Oh. Then go to a cinema. I am sorry I cannot possibly discuss these things to cheer people up, to give them comfort, to give them a sedative. But let us...</p>
<p>Q: But you see you talk about this view, the problem outside you, so can you explain...</p>
<p>K: We will go into that perhaps. If we could talk over together this question of awareness. Is that what you want to discuss?</p>
<p>Q: Awareness - most people are afraid of being aware.</p>
<p>K: So do you want to discuss, do you want to talk over that? Right? Right.</p>
<p>The meaning of that word 'aware', as far as I can make out from the dictionary, as well as from one's own interpretation of that word, is to be conscious, is to be cognisant of the things about you, and also to be aware of the movement of your own feelings and thoughts inwardly, to be aware, to be conscious, to be alert, to be in contact with, to be in relationship with the thing that you are observing, of which you are aware. I think that is the general meaning of that word. Right? Do we all agree to the meaning of that word? Conscious of what one feels, what one thinks, conscious of the environment in which one lives, being aware of the beauty of nature - the clouds, the sky, the water, the various colours and so on and on. Awareness is not a limitation, I am not just aware of this microphone - please listen to this, it is very interesting - I am aware of this microphone in the space which this tent holds. The microphone has its own space, it creates its own space in the space of the tent. And the outer space is beyond - to be aware of this space. Right? To be conscious of it, to see the quality of space. I am only talking...</p>
<p>Now shall we discuss, we will go into it. We are generally, as the lady pointed out earlier, afraid to be aware, afraid to be aware of our environment, if we are aware, from that awareness we come to a conclusion - right? - and that conclusion puts an end to further awareness. I am not giving a talk, please, we are discussing, we are exchanging, we are exposing. So when we say we are aware, we are aware of things very, very superficially. Right? I am aware that you have long hair, or short hair, I am aware of the colour that you are wearing. And I react to the short hair, or the long hair, calling you a hippie, non hippie, square and you know all the rest of it. I react to it and my reaction is the response of my conditioning. The other day I saw a rather good cartoon in the New York, I think I saw it. There was a boy and a girl standing at the window looking out on the street, and two or three hippies were walking down the street, and the boy says to the girl, 'There goes the Establishment'. (laughter) Got it? We react to any form of stimuli, that is an obvious fact. And I am aware of that reaction but I don't penetrate further into that reaction. I am not aware what is the source of that reaction. I am aware of the reaction - like, dislike, pleasure, jealousy, hate, whatever it is - but that awareness brings a conclusion that I am angry, I like and dislike, but we don't allow that awareness to penetrate further. Right?</p>
<p>Now let us experiment, learn what it means to be aware of the things outwardly, that is, the tent, the various poles, the colour of the jerseys people are wearing, the coats, you know, aware outwardly. And then move from that awareness inwardly and see what our reactions are to that which we have visually perceived. And our reactions depend on our temperament and idiosyncrasies. Right? If my temperament is artistic, whatever that word may mean for the moment, I react or I see something much more than the man who is not an artist, in a tree, in a cloud, in the curve of a branch. And my temperament, idiosyncrasy, is the response of my conditioning also. Right? When we say, 'It is my temperament', I think it is a marvellous thing to say that, but the temperament is the response, or the reaction of my conditioning, obviously. Right sirs, are we meeting each other? I don't want to talk all by myself. So see what happens. I am aware of the cloud, the beauty of the cloud, the light in it, the shape of it, the glory of that extraordinary cloud, being an artist, which is my temperament, I want to express it and I pursue that expression, more and more and more. And I separate myself by my temperament from you, who are not an artist. Right? And if I pursue that further inwardly, my conditioning is what is bringing about a temperament, a characteristic, a tendency, an idiosyncrasy. Now I want to find out further if the mind can be free from that conditioning, from all conditioning - you follow? And this is not analysis. I don't know if you... Right?</p>
<p>Q: You mean, since we tend to be creatures of habit, we must have the ability to break straight through the habit.</p>
<p>K: That's right sir.</p>
<p>Q: To be instantaneous.</p>
<p>K: That's right. After all I am - you follow? - I am moving steadily from the outer to the inner. I don't disregard the outer, or neglect the outer; there is poverty, starvation, I am fully aware of it, I have to act about it. I can't just say I am just aware and just sit back. I have to act. And I see this starvation, the poverty, the degradation, the horror of all poverty. And I want to go into it, not say, 'Well, let's organise to feed the poor', or this or... I want to go to the very root of all this. So I move from the obvious to the not so obvious. To me this whole process is to be aware, and I can't move to the root of it if there is any form of prejudice along the line. I don't know if you are... If I have any bias, an opinion, a conclusion, I can't go to the root of it. So my concern is then: have I opinions - you follow sir? Have I any form of conclusions about Nixon, Heath - you follow? - about anybody? Because if I have a conclusion, an opinion, a dogmatic, assertive attitude I can't penetrate, obviously. The mind cannot proceed further. So my awareness reveals that I have a prejudice, that I have a conclusion from which I act. So I then pick up that opinion - you follow? - in that awareness I say, 'Why have I an opinion about something?' - you follow sir? It is a marvellous movement of releasing energy. I don't know if you see the point. A conclusion prevents the flow of energy - get that point sir, get that point. I am just looking at it for myself, I am getting excited about it.</p>
<p>Q: You mean a conclusion is...</p>
<p>K: That's right. If I say, 'There is god' - finished! Or if I say, 'Communists are terrible', or 'The Capitalists are the most marvellous group' and so on and so on, so on. So in this awareness I discover, the mind discovers that any form of conclusion, opinion, prevents the free flow of energy. Then my problem is: how to be free of conclusions and opinions, that's my next... I am talking by myself, won't you join me?</p>
<p>Q: Can't you be unattached to opinions, like there are opinions but you don't take them seriously. I can't exactly explain it.</p>
<p>K: Why should I have opinions?</p>
<p>Q: I see that it is absurd to have opinions, then it doesn't matter whether one says something or says nothing. The two are just equally...</p>
<p>K: Ah, no, no, no. Look sir: opinion is a form of conclusion, isn't it?</p>
<p>Q: Yes, but you are aware that that conclusion does exist in the world.</p>
<p>K: Yes. I am aware that my friend has an opinion, and therefore I realise that opinion blocks him; and I have an opinion also about somebody or other, or about something, that prevents further enquiry. So see what I have discovered.</p>
<p>Q: Well how do you not have opinions when you have got millions of them.</p>
<p>K: How do you not have opinions. How can you be free of opinions when you have got so many of them? You tell me.</p>
<p>Q: I don't know.</p>
<p>K: Wait. That is right. Just start from there, please start from there. I have hundreds of opinions about everything and I say, 'I don't know why I have them, and I don't know how to be free of them'. Right? So you start with not knowing. Right? Then you are able to learn. I don't know... You get it? If you begin to say, 'I must have a few opinions, the good opinions, I'll discard the bad opinions, I'll keep those which are comforting, which are fashionable, which are satisfactory, which gratify', then you are still playing with opinions. Right? So what am I to... I don't know how I have acquired them, I don't know what to do about them. So my mind doesn't know. Right? See the beauty, come on, sir. Now it is capable of learning. That is, I don't know Russian, therefore I want to learn. I want to learn. So my mind now is capable of learning, and learning then becomes a passionate thing, not why you should have opinions, or why you should not have opinions, but not knowing I want to learn, and that gives me tremendous vitality. I don't know if you follow?</p>
<p>Q: It gives me tremendous weariness.</p>
<p>K: Ah, because you want to solve it, you want to get rid of them. You want to conquer them, you want to go beyond them, you want to be free of them. I don't. I know nothing about it, I don't know how I have got it, I don't know how to get rid of them, therefore I am willing to learn.</p>
<p>Q: If you start from not knowing then you can put the question rightly to yourself, which brings interest.</p>
<p>K: Yes, that is right. Now are we doing this together? Please sir, this is fun then, you know.</p>
<p>Q: Isn't there some residue of knowledge?</p>
<p>K: Wait a minute. So you are saying: what is the difference between knowledge and learning. Is that right sir? In learning - let us put it round the other way - in learning do you acquire knowledge and use that knowledge as a means of getting rid of the opinions?</p>
<p>Q: When you look at the world you tend to see things like say, Mr. Heath, if you see politicians working, you realise this kind of energy creates problems, it doesn't solve them and this remains in the mind as knowledge. I mean one isn't just a blank state when you see this.</p>
<p>K: What do you mean by that word 'knowledge' sir? To know.</p>
<p>Q: I think when you see external things...</p>
<p>K: Yes sir, let us go very simply at it sir. Let's begin very simply. What do you mean by that word 'knowledge'? To know. I know you because I met you yesterday, I know your name, I have seen your face, so I say, 'I know you'. Right? I know your name and where you live because we have been introduced, we have talked about it. So what is that? That is a stored-up memory of yesterday's rencontre meeting and that is part of my knowledge. So knowledge is always in the past. Right?</p>
<p>Q: There is always more to learn about anything.</p>
<p>K: It's always... I am adding to it, there is the adding process going on. That is, knowledge is the residue of experience, of accumulated knowledge of the race, of society, of the scientist, biotic, all that, all the accumulation of human endeavour as experience scientifically or personally, is knowledge, to which you are adding or taking away. Knowledge which has no basis, knowledge which has basis. Right?</p>
<p>Q: Are you saying that knowledge and memory are the same?</p>
<p>K: Yes, obviously, obviously. If I have no memory I have no knowledge. What sir? You don't think they are the same.</p>
<p>Q: I said this doesn't mean they are the same if you have no memory you have no knowledge. Knowledge can be a qualification of memory.</p>
<p>K: Let's look at it. Look at it. You have flattered me or insulted me. I react to that. And that remains a memory, it has become my memory - your insult. And the brain retains that memory. I meet a snake or whatever it is, that is again an experience which has been transmitted to me from my generations past that it is a dangerous snake, which is knowledge. Or I experience something totally new and remember it, the remembrance is stored in the brain and that is my memory. So knowledge is either in the books, written down by others, or by myself, and the knowledge which I have kept for myself. This is simple enough, sir.</p>
<p>Now is there a difference between acquiring knowledge and learning? Go on, sir. Enquire. This is fun.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a structure for knowledge, a function of knowledge and the transcendence of knowledge?</p>
<p>K: Yes sir, that is right. Let's use knowledge as functional, because if I don't know how to write, I don't know how to speak, I don't know how to do a job - knowledge is necessary. To function knowledge is necessary. And is learning different from the acquisition of knowledge?</p>
<p>Q: It must be.</p>
<p>K: We are going to find out, we are going to learn. Please sir...</p>
<p>Q: Don't you ask questions out of knowledge. You have certain pre-occupations and then you ask your question. Then you ask your question not of the past.</p>
<p>K: Sir, wait. I have no preoccupation now. All that I am concerned with now is to find out if there is a difference between knowledge and learning. That is not a pre-occupation, I want to find out.</p>
<p>Q: The meaning of the word 'know' is not to acquire knowledge, there is knowing. Like the words 'Know yourself', it is not acquiring knowledge of yourself, it is something new all the time.</p>
<p>K: Ah wait sir, wait, wait. When you use the words 'Know yourself', see how complex it is. To know myself. Right? It has been said, 'Know yourself', you said. To know myself, what does that mean? I must know myself, knowing myself means I must know myself as I am, or as I will be, or as I have been. Right?</p>
<p>Q: It could mean I have organised my memory so that I can predict what I might do in the future.</p>
<p>K: Yes, all that is implied.</p>
<p>Q: I mean in the sense that it is fairly obvious that oneself is not an idea of oneself, so that when there is no idea of oneself, oneself is there.</p>
<p>K: No, if there is no idea of oneself, is there oneself? Don't let's enter into this. I want to stick to one thing at a time, which is: what is the difference, is there a difference between knowledge and learning?</p>
<p>Q: It seems that learning is only perception, when perception moves to conclusion then it has function which makes it knowledge.</p>
<p>K: That's all. That is - he has said it! (laughter) Need I say anything more? I see the importance of learning. I don't know why I have prejudices, I don't know how to be free of them, so I start with not knowing, therefore my mind is capable of learning. Now I must find out the difference between knowledge and learning. Will learning bring knowledge: how to be free from opinions - you follow? - or will learning, which will be constant, in this constant movement no opinion can be formed. I don't know if you see the difference.</p>
<p>Q: You'd say that learning is something vital and in the present, whereas knowledge is always dead, in the past.</p>
<p>K: Always in the past - yes, that is right. First see this sir. I have caught on to something!</p>
<p>Knowledge I can have, knowledge how to get rid of opinions: I must struggle against them, I must control them, I must say, 'I must not have opinions', and keep on repeating, repeating, mechanically. So I say that will not free the mind from opinions. So learning implies never accumulating knowledge, never coming to a conclusion, therefore in the movement of learning how can the mind form a conclusion, or an opinion?</p>
<p>Q: Are you saying...</p>
<p>K: Wait. I don't know what I am saying, (laughter) I am just capturing it.</p>
<p>Q: Where does necessary knowledge stop?</p>
<p>K: Sir, just play with this a little. I am moving - learning implies movement, constant movement and that which is moving can never accumulate, and when you accumulate it becomes knowledge, which is necessary to function. But in learning which is a constant movement, no opinion, no conclusion can ever be formed. Ah, I have got it! Right?</p>
<p>Now are we together now learning? Can you honestly and without any sense of distortion say, 'I really don't know how to get rid of opinions', and, you are beginning to learn. In learning you are asking, 'Am I accumulating'? I know accumulation is necessary - to speak a language, to function - but in the movement of learning is the mind acquiring knowledge in order to be free of opinions? Right? But I say you have put a wrong question because in the movement of learning there can be no accumulation. Right? Now are we doing that together now? So that you, in the movement of learning, have banished opinions, put away opinions? But if you say, 'Wait a minute, I must get rid of opinions', you are acting from a conclusion, which is your knowledge which you have acquired in learning and therefore you have stopped. Therefore you are collecting barnacles, which are opinions. I don't know if you see. Right?</p>
<p>Q: Each time I look intensely, the idea of not seeing it as a leaf - when I am seeing a leaf now I find that when I am looking, actually seeing, in this state of intensive looking I seem to not be able to see myself. It's as if I can just see the intensity of the colours and I'm not there. There are moments when I see...</p>
<p>K: Yes sir, and that of course. So what is the question sir?</p>
<p>Q: I am just amazed!</p>
<p>K: Ah! I understand sir.</p>
<p>Q: How does one change the direction in which one learns. In learning one first chooses a direction...</p>
<p>K: Ah, no. No sir, I have not chosen a direction. Just look what has happened! We said we are going to discuss awareness - just follow this sir, put your mind to it a little bit - we said we were going to talk over together, awareness. I said, we are aware from the outside movement to the inner. In seeing that blue colour I say, 'How terrible that colour is!' - which is the response of my conditioning, my temperament, my etc. etc. And we never go beyond the conclusion. If we go beyond the conclusion I discover there are a thousand opinions I have, then having them I justify them, rationalise them, say these are good opinions, these are bad opinions, the bad opinions I must get rid of and I'll keep the good opinions. There are no good opinions or bad opinions, there are only opinions, which are conclusions.</p>
<p>Q: They are like the currency of psychological life, you just play around with them like cigarette cards.</p>
<p>K: Quite right sir. Quite right, you play with them.</p>
<p>Q: Squirm with them.</p>
<p>K: Squirm with them and bite with them, whatever it is. And you go further. Say, 'How have I got these opinions?' - culture, society, the family, tradition, the mother saying, 'Do this, don't do that', the father saying, 'That is good' - you follow? - society, the culture has given me these opinions, these conclusions and now I am faced with them I say, I don't know how to get rid of them. So I don't know how to get rid of them, there is only one factor: I don't know.</p>
<p>Q: I am lazy.</p>
<p>K: No, no wait, I don't know. Then it may be I am lazy. I am lazy and decide I don't know and remain there because I am indolent, my brain is sluggish, so I say, 'I don't know, it is very nice' and remain. The brain is active, I am not going to let my stupid brain become lazy - you understand? The brain itself now is enquiring. Now I don't know and then I ask: what is the difference between knowledge and learning? We have explained that. Learning is a constant movement in which at no time can it collect, which becomes knowledge, which is essential for functioning. But learning goes on and therefore in the movement of learning nothing can be collected, except as a function. As a function if you introduce opinions, the function becomes non-functional. Right? That's all.</p>
<p>So I have discovered all this in awareness, which is, I see all this instantly. It takes time to explain but the perception is instantaneous and therefore doesn't require analysis. I don't know if you are getting all this.</p>
<p>Q: Does it require effort to keep the movement going?</p>
<p>K: Ah, does it require effort to keep learning going? What do you say?</p>
<p>Q: No effort at all.</p>
<p>K: Why do you say that?</p>
