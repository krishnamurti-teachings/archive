<p>As there has been so much confusion as to what I have been talking about, I am going to try and explain it, and put it differently, and I hope I shall make it simpler.</p>
<p>We have an idea that completeness, wholeness, can be understood or realized through a part. You come with your particular problem, and you try to seek a solution for that particular problem and try to apply what I have been saying little by little to that particular problem. You hope to understand that wholeness, that completeness, through a particular part, through a particular problem. Now, the idea of a series of ideas forming a teaching or of coming to the whole through any one of those single ideas, is to me utterly false. First of all, you say I am giving you a certain teaching, then you take a single idea from the whole and try to apply that one idea to your particular problem. So you hope to come to the fullness of the whole through the particular.</p>
<p>Now, you come here with the mentality that whatever is troubling you, you want to have solved, and hope that you will find a solution through a particular teaching that I am giving by using one of the ideas of that teaching as a means of solving your problem. That is, by gradually accumulating and understanding a series of problems, you hope you will come to the fullness of the totality - that immensity of life. So you say to yourself, “I shall grow into the whole through understanding, through gathering many particulars.”</p>
<p>With all these accumulations, with these methods, you seek to understand what I am saying. Each one has a different problem, and you come to listen to me in the hope that applying one idea of which I am talking to your special problem, you will come to the totality, to the wholeness. Most of us are crippled with that idea: that we shall come to the whole through a part.</p>
<p>Now, with that idea you come and say, “Please help me to understand my particular problem.” Do not look at what I have been saying with that idea of trying to solve a problem, because I want to show that, in understanding one experience, the whole is realized. In understanding the cause of one problem, you will understand the whole, if you approach the problem intelligently. As it is now, we make an effort, like a fish caught in a net, to escape from that problem or to seek a solution of that problem, to be rid of it. We say to ourselves, “If I can only be rid of the many hindrances, then I shall realize the whole.” So you make a tremendous effort to be rid of these hindrances.</p>
<p>What I want to show is that, where there is effort to be rid of something, you create another barrier; whereas, in the movement of action in the present, there is awareness of the hindrances which prevent you from action. Now we say, “I must be rid of the hindrances in order to realize that totality of life.” So you make an effort to get rid of these hindrances. But in fact, in your desire to conquer truth, you are merely running away from your hindrances when you say you must get rid of them.</p>
<p>Because your longing for truth is so great, you run away from your hindrances. So, in trying to conquer your hindrances, you are like a fish caught in a net; whereas, in the movement of action you will become aware of the hindrances, and in that awareness you will be freed of these hindrances, because you will understand their cause. You are trying to get rid of hindrances because you are wanting truth, while before you wanted a savior, Masters, discipleship, heaven, etc. Now you want liberation in the same way. So you say, “I must get rid of hindrances,” and you make a tremendous effort, a desperate effort to get rid of them. Whereas, to understand the totality of life, you cannot come to it or realize it or understand it through effort, because effort is merely an endeavor to overcome something. Where there is conquering, there is an escape. So do not make an effort to be rid of hindrances. In the movement of action - and action is always in the present, not in the dead past - in that movement of action in the present, you will be aware why your actions are not complete, what prevents you from completing that particular action. Then you will know the cause.</p>
<p>But, you will say to me, “The past hindrance is fully alive, it holds me; it is so alive that I cannot act freely in the present.” What gives life to past hindrances? The vitality of past hindrances is caused through memory, conscious or unconscious, and we act from that memory. I have a hindrance and my memory is attached to that hindrance, consciously or subconsciously, and I act from that reaction, which I call memory. It is simple, if you think about it a little. We are acting from memory, memory of an idea, a mental picture, a social standard, etc. and so we give life to the hindrances of the past. And we increase and give vitality to that hindrance all the time. Now, this memory which exists when there is incomplete action, this series of memories, these layers of memory, make up self-consciousness, the ‘I’, from which all action takes place. This memory, this incompleteness, which is always impressing itself on our minds and hearts, creates the ‘I’ and this is the source of the ‘I’.</p>
<p>To put it differently, the ‘I’, self-consciousness, that ‘I’ which is active, is nothing but a bundle of inherited perversions, social virtues, and their opposites. Our action, then, which is but a reaction, comes from this memory, which we call the ‘I’. So that ‘I’ is the creator of illusion, and what we are doing now is to try to get rid of illusions one by one. You say, “I am in a particular illusion and I must get rid of it.” And so you battle, make a tremendous effort to be free of it. But in that very effort you are creating another illusion, because of the very idea to get free of it, escape from it, conquer it. Whereas to me, when you understand that, your whole series of problems ceases to exist. You cannot approach that wholeness through a series of problems, and that is what we are trying to do, and that is our whole conception of the accumulation of knowledge, virtues, qualities. To understand the whole, which shall dissolve every other conflict and problem, one experience or one problem rightly understood will reveal the cause which creates the problem. Now we are trying to solve the difficulty without understanding who or what created the difficulty. We are trying to solve our particular problem through a desire to be rid of it, by applying a particular idea to it or by submerging it in a mental picture or trying to forget it through sensation. In that very process we are but creating another problem, and so we go on creating one problem after another until we die, all the time making a series of efforts to get rid of them. But to understand the whole which shall free the mind of all these particularities, from this accumulation, we must understand who creates the illusions, these bondages, these hindrances. They are all created out of this bundle of memories which is called the ‘I’, through memory, which is incomplete action.</p>
<p>Now I say, do not examine, consciously or subconsciously, hindrances which lie in the past; do not dig out from the dead past into the present all the dead hindrances, but begin to live in the present and then in that living quality all our hindrances come into activity without your going back. In that there is a joy; whereas, in going back and trying to understand and dig out, through effort, the hindrances of the past, you but create another center of the ‘I’. Instead of being in the past, it comes into the present; egotism still remains and therefore it is a hindrance in itself.</p>
<p>It is like a ship: in its movement it knows its hindrances. If it is still it cannot know its hindrances. Now you are still and trying to dig out from the past or trying to get rid of your hindrances. But that is purely a mental picture, a process, a mental effort, which to me is the utter destruction of action, of living. Whereas, if in your movement, if in your action, whatever it is, you are both mentally and emotionally fully awake, then you will know what is impeding you, and in that flame of awareness that impediment is destroyed, because you have understood the cause.</p>
<p>So I hope you see that it is not through the accumulation of ideas, of experience, of knowledge, that you can come to that fullness, that plenitude of life; nor through making an effort to liberate yourself from hindrances, which again is utterly false. But in your action you become aware of your hindrances, and you will if you act with completeness, with your whole mind and heart; then, in that awareness, you will know what the hindrances are, and therefore the cause.</p>
<p>But then you will tell me, “I am incapable of meeting experience fully; therefore, I go into the subconscious and drag out all the hindrances, so that I can meet fully the present.” But you do meet fully, completely, everything in which you are interested. If that action or if that problem is really vital, then you do meet it fully. So what is happening? You do not meet things fully, because you are all the time trying to escape. Do not say, I must get rid of escape, but become conscious that you are escaping and then you will cease to escape.</p>
<p>What I want to convey is very difficult to put into words. You cannot understand the whole significance of life through a division, through a part; and all our effort is to go through a part, through individuality, through getting rid of hindrances, through effort, which creates another particularity. Effort exists so long as there is a part, and you cannot come through a part to the whole.</p>
<p>You cannot understand it, you cannot realize the whole loveliness of that completeness through a little thing, though one experience will, if rightly approached, give you the whole. If there is a cessation of the creator of illusions and therefore of the illusions themselves, then you will know the whole, but you cannot destroy that through effort, because the more effort you make against it, the greater the resistance. Please understand this, because to me this is the vital point. Where we make an effort, we but increase and emphasize the part and therefore there is no comprehension of the whole. And we make an effort because we are all the time wanting to gain, to accumulate, to be rid of things; whereas, in that flame of awareness which arises when a problem is really acute, when you are really interested with your whole mind and heart, then you will know the creator of illusion, the ‘I’ with all its hindrances, qualities, virtues, limitations. The moment you know the creator of illusion, there is a cessation of the cause, which creates illusions.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>I have thought much about liberation and longed to achieve it. Now I have a new idea. Perhaps it is life that requires to be liberated from me. Perhaps life could flow in its own beautiful way if I, with all my obstacles and hindrances, were out of the way. If this is a true thought, how am I to eliminate and efface myself so that life may have things all its own way?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First of all, that knowledge which you have gathered in search of liberation must totally disappear because you have gathered it with the idea of gain, with the idea that you should be liberated, that there is liberation, therefore I must seek it. All knowledge must disappear to understand that which is whole, knowledge which you have accumulated through this craving for liberation, and therefore that knowledge is not true. That is the first thing, and is the most difficult.</p>
<p>How do you know what liberation is, to long for it? You say, “I know it because I have had a momentary glimpse of it.” So you say, “Are those glimpses true or false?” That is the second point. I say then: Why do you ask whether they are true or false? Because you want to find out whether you have experienced that reality; whereas, to me this is not important. What are you concerned with when you have pain, physical pain, twisted ankle or twisted arm, or tummy ache, or headache, or other ache? When you have no pain you do not say, “Are those moments real when I had no pain?” You are concerned with the riddance of the pain. Then you will know for yourself whether that which you have experienced is true or false, permanent or transient. Now your chief concern is for liberation, only you have changed the word. You had the same desire before: Masters, saviors, ceremonies, virtues. Now you have changed the word, and you want that equally, you want that either as an escape or because you are satiated with life, all the incidents of life. You want something more, more sensation. So, you can only be conscious of the struggle, not of liberation. Struggle, conflict, pain, suffering are the only things that we can know and be positive of; all the other things are a negation, imagination, mental pictures that act as drugs.</p>
<p>So, your search for liberation is wholly false; it is a mental desire, stimulation; therefore, it cannot have a particle of truth in it. So being conscious of suffering, the next thing you say is, “How shall I get rid of it?” You say, “I must not search for liberation, but I must be rid of suffering.” To be rid of suffering you create another idea, and so you go on; whereas, if you are acutely conscious, aware, of your suffering, you will know the cause. If you want to catch anything, you stop its escape. Intellectually, you have created so many holes through which you run away. I say, block up all those holes through understanding, and then you will face your problems completely, and then you will find out the creator, the cause of that problem. And in that freedom there is the realization of that fullness. So do not say, “I must become conscious of hindrances,” or, “I must get rid of hindrances, barriers, in the hope that I shall realize truth,” but begin to live, begin to move, begin to act with full awareness, that is, with your mind as well as with your heart. Then you will know what are the impediments. Any other way is a mental picture; any other way demands an effort, creating another set of barriers. Thus, you will discover the true values of your action - not the value that society, inherited prejudices, your own escapes and fears give to that particular action - but in the movement of action, when you are acting, if you are really awake both mentally and emotionally, in that you will discover right values. Therefore, you will be free of the false. Hence, in that discovery of what is true the totality is realized.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Will you speak further of the relation between understanding and action? For example, in trying to be aware, I find a certain want or craving, but though I have Med to force it, frankly, it still remains.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To me action and understanding are the same thing. Understanding is not a mental thing, nor is action apart from your feeling and thought; it is all one. Your action, if it is complete, can only be born out of a harmony of mind and heart, and that is understanding. So you cannot divide action from understanding.</p>
<p>You say, “In trying to be aware, I find a certain want or craving, but though I have tried to force it, frankly, it still remains.” You see, you are still trying to be aware - I am not quibbling. Awareness is not natural, so you make an effort to be aware, as you make an effort to achieve liberation, as you are making an effort to be rid of hindrances. So when you say, “I am trying to be aware,” you are not aware. When you say, “I must be virtuous,” “I must struggle for virtue,” then it is no longer a virtue. So, likewise, when you say, “I am trying to be aware,” in that there is no value, because awareness is harmony of action in which there is not a duality, as the control and the controller, as the actor and the action. That complete harmony in action happens when you are doing something with your whole being. Now you are not, because you are afraid of society, of your friends, of your neighbors. You are afraid, therefore you act partially, incompletely.</p>
<p>So, when you do anything, do it completely. Do not try to be aware. And in that doing completely, you will find out. And you do that when you are in love, when you are carried away by something immense. But that is merely a stimulation. When you see a beautiful picture, a beautiful painting, you are carried away; momentarily you are all in one, your action is complete, harmonious. That is, an external beauty has completely knocked out of you this idea of ‘I’, this particular.</p>
<p>The questioner wants to know if he has not gone to the root of the matter in trying to become aware of what causes this craving. “Is it that I have not gone to the root of the matter? Why should the ‘I’ cease wanting through becoming aware, conscious of this wanting?” I have explained. You know, when you are jealous, mentally, either you are not fully aware that you are jealous or you are. If you are not aware that you are jealous, then that is a different question. If you are aware, you realize intellectually the foolishness of it. You say, “How absurd!” “How childish!” “How unreal!” But emotionally you are eaten up with jealousy, because you want to possess, you want to be certain, and all the rest. It is no good fighting against jealousy. You must not say, “I must conquer it, I must get rid of it” - all mental images, superimposing on this emotional thing which wants. Whereas, if you really find out if you are jealous, both mentally and emotionally, you would be free of jealousy. You know, people like to be jealous because it gives them a sensation, also pain. They revel in it, and at the same time they want to get rid of it. If you want to get rid of it, get rid of it wholly. That is, when jealousy becomes acute, and it is really a problem, then you deal with it completely. Now we want it and at the same time we don’t want it, and hence the mind tries to impose discipline, get rid of it, smother it, suppress it. That is why I say: Live all the time intensely; let everything be a crisis, and if one thing is really in crisis, then you will find out the creator of the illusion which creates that crisis.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You often speak about time and timelessness, but to me it seems that time is an illusion. Though we can’t get rid of it, it must he so, for every moment is an illusion. The very moment it is, it is passed - something like a knife cutting that divides a thing into two parts, past and future, but it doesn’t exist itself. So, mentally, time is an illusion to me.</p>
<p><i>Does the life that you know include the fact that you live in that timeless reality, that you actually see the totality of time? Please will you explain, as everything in the world connected with time seems so futile to me.</i></p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why do you ask? If time is an illusion, it is an illusion. But you go further and explain time as an illusion mentally. That we all know; we all say, “Time is an illusion.” It is a phrase.</p>
<p>Timelessness is a thing that one has to realize. It is not a mental picture. So do not let us talk about it. Let us find out what creates time, in which mind is caught up. You see the difference? Timelessness, or rather that which has no beginning and no end, is a thing that you cannot talk about, any more than you can talk about truth or God. It is. It must be experienced fully. So to describe it would be false. It cannot be mentally realized. Whereas, we can find out why mind and heart are caught up in time. You see the difference? You are asking me the same question as when you say, “Tell me what truth is, tell me what God is.” So you say, “Tell me what timelessness is.” I say: I cannot tell you; you cannot talk about it; you cannot put it into words. Anything which is explained is not true. So we can find out what is the cause, as a past, a present, and a future. When we have understood that, then we enter into a different world, of timelessness.</p>
<p>Now do not ask, “Is there not a tomorrow; are you not going to arrange for a lecture tomorrow; are you not going to be punctual for your talk; must we not have a timetable to catch our trains?” I am not talking about that sort of thing. To me, what creates time is memory, and memory is born out of incomplete action.</p>
<p>What then creates incompleteness in our minds? I say: It is our action, which is but a reaction, born out of this ‘I’ consciousness, which is the cause of illusion. We act and our action is not a complete action; it is but a reaction born of fear, inherited perversions, social standards, which we have not understood, a search for reward and the escape from punishment, sorrow. From all this we act. Our action is but a reaction on account of this. Such an action is bound to create memory because we do not understand and we do not meet every experience fully, but with these reactions. It is like the sunlight, coming through the plain glass or a colored glass. So, with this background of false values, we act and hence our action evokes incompleteness, and hence the many layers of memory which divide life into past, present, and future.</p>
<p>How do you act? You say you do not know. That is just it. Nobody is going to reveal it to you. You may be acting from a prejudice, from a fear, from a desire to lay up a store for the future - whether wealth, accumulations, or experiences. So you are unconscious of your action, but you are acting in this way all the time; therefore, you have to become aware of the background from which you act. To become aware of that background, do not go into the past.</p>
<p>So, through our action time exists. Time to me is <i>karma,</i> action limited. Where there is memory, it is born out of the action which is incomplete, and that memory creates time. Don’t say then, “Must I be free of memory?”, which is again approaching it wrongly. It is the cause that matters, not the effect. The cause of memory is this action born out of reaction, out of a background.</p>
<p>Do not try to imagine what timelessness is or what it is to be without time. To me, all such things have no inherent value. But what has lasting, permanent value is to understand right values, and you cannot understand right values with a mind that is caught up in a background of reaction, or ready-made reaction. Whenever your actions are from that, they must be incomplete; therefore, there is always the incrustation of memory and hence the more and more self-conscious limitation which creates time.</p>
