<p>One of the greatest difficulties that we have is to find out what makes for mediocrity. You know what that word means? A mediocre mind really means a mind that is impaired, that is not free, that is caught in fear, in a problem; it is a mind that merely revolves round its own self-interest, round its own success and failure, its own immediate solutions of the sorrows that inevitably come to a petty mind. It is one of the most difficult things, is it not, for a mind that is mediocre to break away from its own habits of thought, from its own pattern of action, and be free to live, to move about, to act. Most of our minds are very small, are very petty. Look at your own mind and you will see what it is occupied with - such small things as passing an examination, your own success, what people think of you, how you are afraid of somebody. You want a job, and when you have that job, you want to have a better one, and so on. If you search your mind, you will find it is all the time occupied with this kind of small, trivial, self-interested activity. Being thus occupied, it creates problems, does it not? It tries to solve those problems according to its own pettiness but cannot do so, and merely increases them. It seems to me that the function of education is to break down this way of thinking.</p>
<p>The mediocre mind, the mind that is caught in one of the narrow streets of Banaras and lives there, may read, it may pass examinations, it may be socially very active, but it still lives in the narrow little street of its own making. I think it is very important for all of us, the old and the young, to see that as the mind is so small, whatever effort it makes, whatever struggles it may go through, whatever hopes or fears or longings it may have, they are still small, they are still petty. It is very difficult for most of us to realize that the gurus, the Masters, the societies, the religions which the petty mind forms, are still petty. It is very difficult to break this pattern of thinking.</p>
<p>Is it not very important while we are young to have teachers, educators, who are not mediocre? Because, if the educators are dull, weary, are thinking of little things and are caught in their own pettiness, naturally they cannot help to bring about an atmosphere in which the student can be free and break through the pattern which society has imposed upon people.</p>
<p>I think it is very important to be able to know that one is mediocre because most of us do not admit we are mediocre; we all think that we have something extraordinary lurking behind, somewhere. But we have to know that we are mediocre, to realize that mediocrity further creates pettiness, and yet not act against it. Any action against mediocrity is itself born of mediocrity; to try to break down mediocrity is still petty, trivial.</p>
<p>Don't you understand all this? Unfortunately, I am speaking only in English, but I hope your teachers will help you to understand. In explaining this to you, their own triviality will break down. The very explanation will awaken them to their own pettiness, smallness. A small mind cannot love, is not generous, quarrels over trivial things. What is needed in India and elsewhere in the world is not clever people, not people with degrees or big positions, but people - ordinary people like you and me - who have broken down the triviality of their mind.</p>
<p>Triviality is essentially the thought of oneself. That is what makes the mind trivial - the constant occupation about its own success, with one's own ideals, about one's own desires to become perfect. Because the 'me', the self, however much it may expand, is still very small. So, the mind that is occupied is a petty mind; the mind that is constantly thinking about something, worried about its examinations, worried as to whether it will get a job, what its father and mother or teachers or gurus or neighbors or society thinks, is a petty mind. The occupation with these ideas only makes for respectability, and the respectable mind, the mediocre mind, is not a happy mind.</p>
<p>Please listen to all this. You all want to be respectable, don't you? - to do the right thing, to be well-thought of by somebody, by your father or by your neighbor or by your society - and this creates fear; such a mind can never think of anything new. What is needed in this deteriorating world is a mind that is creative, not merely inventing or having some other capacity. That creativeness comes only when there is no fear, when the mind is not occupied with its own problems. All this requires an atmosphere in which the student is really free - free not to do whatever he likes, but free to question, to investigate, to find out, to reason, and to go beyond the reason. The student requires a freedom in which he can find out what he really loves to do in life so that he is not forced to do a particular thing which he loathes, which he does not like.</p>
<p>A mediocre mind never revolts; it submits to government, to parental authority; it puts up with anything. I am afraid in a country like this, where there is overpopulation, where livelihood is very, very difficult, these pressures make us obey, make us submit, and gradually the spirit of revolt, the spirit of discontent, is destroyed. A school of this kind should educate the student to have that tremendous discontent right through life, which cannot be truly satisfied. The discontent begins to find out, becomes really intelligent, if it does not find a channel of satisfaction, of gratification.</p>
<p>So education is a very complex thing, it is not just going through some classes and passing examinations and getting a job. Education is a life process, a constant uncovering of the whole significance of life, and the teachers are not prepared for it. That is why they must be educated, in order to educate the children. You go through these examinations, get jobs, and then what happens to you? You get married, you have children, you are worried, you have little money, and you are swallowed up in this whole mass of the average mind. That is what happens. All those who have passed the gates of any university just disappear; they do not revolt and create a new society, a new way of thinking, they do not break down the old pattern. Instead, they just become the average, mediocre mind. I think really the function of the school at Rajghat is to break down this mediocrity so that you can be a different person when you leave here, a creative human being who will bring about a new world. You see, that requires on the part of the teachers, on the part of the elders, on the part of the parents, a great deal of understanding, a great deal of affection. If a school of this kind cannot do that, it has no business to exist. It is very important that all of us - the students, the teachers, the parents, everyone who comes here - should understand this and create conditions in which the petty mind, the small, mediocre mind, is transformed so that it can live and be in that creative spirit without fear. To do so, we must have great affection and understanding.</p>
<p>Questioner: Why do we boys and girls feel shy of each other?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: Why do you feel shy? Have you ever seen two sparrows, male and female sparrows, two birds on the windowsill, chattering away? They are different, are they not? The male has a black chest and the female has not. One is rather timid; the other is more aggressive, it attacks. Have you not noticed it? Obviously a boy and a girl are not the same physically. Girls have a different body, their nerves are different. Perhaps a girl is sensitive, shy, and a boy is more rough. Physically a girl is differently constructed from a boy. There is a whole problem behind that, the problem of sex, which is nature's way of creating babies. Nobody tells us of these things and all the implications. We are allowed to grow up wild, ignorant in this thing, and that is why we feel shy.</p>
<p>Also the Indian society keeps the male, the female, and the little children apart. The old people have a great many ideas of what is right and what is wrong - that the woman must be kept in the house, the woman is inferior, someone to he looked down upon, to be used, made into a cook, someone to have children. Naturally if you are a girl, you grow up in fear, in apprehension, in nervousness, anxiety, so that you are not a creative human being at all but just a dull, hard-working woman. You have no amusements, you do not paint, you do not think, you may have passed some examinations, but they do not mean a thing to you. You become an ordinary woman like the rest, and the boy exactly the same.</p>
<p>Education at present is the most destructive way of dealing with human beings. We are not helped to understand life, to love life, to see the enormous beauty, the richness of existence, to know of death and also the living thing of life. We are not shown all that. All that we are told is ''do'' and ''don't.'' Brutally or aggressively you are beaten, scolded, bullied, so naturally when you are young, and when you grow up, you are shy. The whole problem is never understood because behind it there is fear. Is it not the function of the educator to explain, to show all this so that, while a student, you understand the difficulties, the subtleties? You can understand the difficulties, the subtleties, the immense problems involved in all these things, only when there is no fear.</p>
<p>Questioner: Is it right that fame comes after death?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: Do you think that the villager who dies will have fame afterwards?</p>
<p>Questioner: A great man, after he dies, becomes famous and is honored.</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: What is a great man? Let us find out the truth of that question. Is he one who seeks fame? Is he one who would give himself tremendous importance? Is he one who identifies himself with a country and becomes a leader? If he does this, he has fame while he is living. That is what we all want; we all want the same thing, to be great people. You want to lead the procession, you want to be the governor, you want to be the great ideal, the great person who is going to reform India. Since you want that, maybe you will lead the procession. But is that greatness? Does greatness consist in being publicized, in having your name appear in the papers, having authority over people, making people obey because you have a strong will or personality or some kink in the mind? Surely, greatness is something totally different.</p>
<p>Greatness is anonymity, to be anonymous is the greatest thing. Great cathedrals, great sculpture, all the great things of life, must be anonymous. Like truth, they do not belong to any particular person. Truth does not belong to you or to me, it is totally impersonal and anonymous. If you say you have got truth, then you are not anonymous, you are making yourself more important than truth. But an anonymous person may never be great because he does not want to be great - great in the sense of the world, or even inwardly, because he is nobody. He has no followers, he has no shrine, he does not puff himself up. But most of us, unfortunately, like to puff ourselves up, we want to be great, we want to be known, we want to have success. Success leads to fame, but that is an empty thing, is it not? It is like ashes. Every politician is known, for it is his business to be known; therefore, he is not truly great. Greatness is to be unknown, inwardly and outwardly to be as nothing, and that requires great penetration, great understanding, great affection.</p>
<p>Questioner: If we respect anyone, there is fear. Then why do we respect?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: It is fairly simple. If you respect out of fear, you want something from that person, don't you? Therefore you do not respect him at all. All that you want is to get something out of him. So, you bow down very low, touch his feet, and put a garland round his neck. That is not respect; respect is something entirely different. To respect another requires affection, not fear. When you respect somebody from whom you are hoping to get something, then you will despise people who are below you, you will have contempt for others. A man who has contempt for another can never be free from fear, can he?</p>
<p>Is it not possible to have affection in oneself which naturally expresses itself as respect for every person, regardless of whether one gets something or not? Watch the way you treat the coolie, the laborer, the servant of your hostel, and the way you treat your housemaster or the principal or a member of the Foundation - the scale going up and up - and you will see the manner of your behavior. You do not get up when the coolie comes in, but when your teacher comes in, you jump up, and the teacher demands that you jump up because he thinks that you must show respect to him. But he does not insist that you should treat the servant with equal respect and talk to him gently and kindly.</p>
<p>Is it not important to know all this while you are young so that you do not become slaves to authority, so that you have real affection and respect for people, which you show to the servant as well as to the man whom you think to be more important? But as long as there is fear and no affection, you are bound to have contempt for the one, and so-called respect for the other.</p>
<p>Questioner: Why does the elder brother beat the younger sister, and the younger sister beat the younger brother?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: That is a very good question. Have you ever watched a chicken and seen how the more powerful pecks the weaker, and the weaker chicken pecks the still weaker one? But you do not watch anything, though there is life all about you. You do not look, you do not observe - neither your teachers nor yourselves. That is how life is. Among the animals, the stronger destroys the weaker. And that is what we also do in human society. The strong man pushes out his chest and beats everybody, and the weaker one gets angry with the still weaker.</p>
<p>You ask why we do this. For the very simple reason that we want to do it. If we are beaten by a big man, we want to take it out on the little man. You know the desire to hurt is very strong in us. We want to hurt people. There is a pleasure in hurting people, in saying cruel things about people, ugly things, belittling them. We never speak of people with kindliness. We never speak of their goodness but always talk with a sneer. That is what has to be understood - not why the elder sister beats the younger sister, and so on. The elder sister is probably beaten by the father or mother, therefore she has to take it out on somebody. She beats the younger and the younger takes it out on the little ones.</p>
<p>To understand cruelty, to understand animosity and not create it is very difficult for most people. We never think of all these things. In our schools these acts of cruelty are never pointed out because the teacher does not see them himself. He has his own problems, he has to get through the class and push the students through some examinations. Please do watch all the things that are taking place about you - how the chickens fight each other, how the strong bulldog dominates everything else. You will find that the same spirit of domination, anger, hatred, and animosity is in each one of us. To dispel this, we have only to be aware of it, and not to consider it as wrong or right.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is freedom?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: I wonder if you really want to know what freedom is! Do any of us know what is freedom? All that we know is that we are made to do things, we are compelled by circumstances or through our own fears to do things, and we want to break away from them. The breaking away from restraint, from compulsion, from fear, or anything else is what we call freedom. Please listen.</p>
<p>The breaking away from restraint, the breaking away from a hindrance, the breaking away from some form of compulsion, is not freedom. Freedom is something in itself, not away from something. Please understand this. The man put in a prison for some cause wants to break away and be free. He only thinks in terms of breaking away. If I am envious, I feel that if I can only break away from envy, I will be free. But the overcoming of envy is not freedom; the breaking away, the suppressing, is merely another expression of the same thing. The love of something for itself is freedom. There is freedom when you paint because you love to paint, not because it gives you fame or gives you a position. In the school, when you love to paint, that very love is freedom, and that needs an astonishing understanding of all the ways of the mind. Surely it is very simple to do something for itself and not for what it brings you, either as a punishment or as a reward. Just to love the thing for itself is the beginning of freedom.</p>
<p>Do you spend ten minutes of your class period talking of all these things? Or do you plunge immediately into geography, mathematics, English, and all the rest of it? What happens? Why don't you do this for ten minutes every day, instead of wasting your time on some stupid stuff which does not really interest you but which has to be done? Why don't you spend some time with your teacher in class talking about these matters? This would help you in your life - though it might not help you to become great or successful or famous. If you talk about these matters every day for ten minutes, intelligently, fearlessly, then it will help you all through life because it will make you think and not merely repeat things like parrots. So, please ask your teachers to talk to you about these matters. Then you will find both the educator and yourself becoming more intelligent.</p>
<p>Questioner: Can nature get rid of nature's dependence? If dependence is equivalent to fear, can we ever get rid of nature's dependence?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: When we are very young, as babies, we are dependent; we depend on the mother for milk; we need to be protected, to be watched, to be cared for. That is inevitable for the child and for every bird, every animal. All the puppies in this place are guarded by the mother. That is a natural thing. But as we grow, if we depend on somebody for happiness, for comfort, for guidance, for security, then out of that dependence comes fear. Dependence makes us dull, insensitive, fearful. We do depend on the railway, on the post office, but that is not dependence; that is a function in which both of us are partaking. But the dependence of which I am talking is inward, inside. It is that inward dependence that creates fear, that clouds our mind, making it dull, heavy, insensitive.</p>
<p>We depend because in ourselves we are so empty, in ourselves there is nothing, not a seed that is flowering. But we do not know anything about these things, and it is the function of education, is it not, to show all the implications of human existence, outwardly and inwardly. Our living is not just what appears outwardly; that is very superficial. A great many deeper things are hidden in us. To understand all that, to unravel it and go beyond, is the function of education, is it not?</p>
