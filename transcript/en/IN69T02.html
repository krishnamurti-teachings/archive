<p>What is important in meditation is the quality of the mind and the heart.  It is not what you achieve, or what you say you attain, but rather the quality of a mind that is innocent and vulnerable. Through negation there is the positive state.  Merely to gather, or to live in, experience, denies the purity of meditation.  Meditation is not a means to an end.  It is both the means and the end.  The mind can never be made innocent through experience.  It is the negation of experience that brings about that positive state of innocency which cannot be cultivated by thought.  Thought is never innocent.  Meditation is the ending of thought, not by the meditator, for the meditator is the meditation.  If there is no meditation, then you are like a blind man in a world of great beauty, light and colour.</p>
<p>Wander by the seashore and let this meditative quality come upon you.  If it does, don't pursue it.  What you pursue will be the memory of what it was - and what was is the death of what is.  Or when you wander among the hills, let everything tell you the beauty and the pain of life, so that you awaken to your own sorrow and to the ending of it.  Meditation is the root, the plant, the flower and the fruit.  It is words that divide the fruit, the flower, the plant and the root.  In this separation action does not bring about goodness: virtue is the total perception.</p>
<p>It was a long shady road with trees on both sides - a narrow road that wound through the green fields of glistening, ripening wheat. The sun made sharp shadows, and the villages on both sides of the road were dirty, ill-kept and poverty-ridden.  The older people looked ill and sad, but the children were shouting and playing in the dust and throwing stones at the birds high up in the trees.  It was a very pleasant cool morning and a fresh breeze was blowing over the hills.</p>
<p>The parrots and the mynahs were making a great deal of noise that morning.  The parrots were hardly visible among the green leaves of the trees; in the tamarind they had several holes which were their home.  Their zig-zag flight was always screechy and raucous.  The mynahs were on the ground, fairly tame.  They would let you come quite near them before they flew away.  And the golden fly-catcher, the green and golden bird, was on the wires across the road.  It was a beautiful morning and the sun was not too hot yet.  There was a benediction in the air and there was that peace before man wakes up.</p>
<p>On that road a horse-drawn vehicle with two wheels and a platform with four posts and an awning was passing by.  On it, stretched across the wheels, wrapped up in a white and red cloth, was a dead body being carried to the river to be burnt on its banks.  There was a man sitting beside the driver, probably a relative, and the body was jolting up and down on that not too smooth road.  They had come from some distance for the horse was sweating, and the dead body had been shaking all the way and it seemed to be quite rigid.</p>
<p>The man who came to see us later that day said he was a gunnery instructor in the navy.  He had come with his wife and two children and he seemed a very serious man.  After salutations he said that he would like to find God.  He was not too articulate, probably he was rather shy.  His hands and face looked capable but there was a certain hardness in his voice and look - for, after all, he was an instructor in the ways of killing.  God seemed to be so remote from his everyday activities.  It all seemed so weird, for here was a man who said he was in earnest in his search for God and yet his livelihood forced him to teach others the art of killing.</p>
<p>He said he was a religious man and had wandered through many schools of different so-called holy men.  He was dissatisfied with them all, and now he had taken a long journey by train and bus to come and see us for he wanted to know how to come upon that strange world which men and saints have sought.  His wife and children sat very silent and respectful, and on a branch just outside the window sat a dove, light brown, softly cooing to itself.  The man never looked at it, and the children with their mother sat rigid, nervous and unsmiling.</p>
<p>You can't find God; there is no way to it.  Man has invented many paths, many religions, many beliefs, saviours and teachers whom he thinks will help him to find the bliss that is not passing.  The misery of search is that it leads to some fancy of the mind, to some vision which the mind has projected and measured by things known. The love which he seeks is destroyed by the way of his life.  You cannot have a gun in one hand and God in the other.  God is only a symbol, a word, that has really lost its meaning, for the churches and places of worship have destroyed it.  Of course, if you don't believe in God you are like the believer; both suffer and go through the sorrow of a short and vain life; and the bitterness of every day makes life a meaningless thing.  Reality is not at the end of the stream of thought, and the empty heart is filled by the words of thought.  We become very clever, inventing new philosophies, and then there is the bitterness of their failure.  We have invented theories about how to reach the ultimate, and the devotee goes to the temple and loses himself in the imaginations of his own mind.  The monk and the saint do not find that reality for both are part of a tradition, of a culture, that accepts them as being saints and monks.</p>
<p>The dove has flown away, and the beauty of the mountain of cloud is upon the land - and truth is there, where you never look.</p>
