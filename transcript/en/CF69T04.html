<p>Sleep is as important as keeping awake, perhaps more so.  If during the day-time the mind is watchful, self-recollected, observing the inward and outward movement of life, then at night meditation comes as a benediction.  The mind wakes up, and out of the depth of silence there is the enchantment of meditation, which no imagination or flight of fancy can ever bring about.  It happens without the mind ever inviting it: it comes into being out of the tranquillity of consciousness - not within it but outside of it, not in the periphery of thought but beyond the reaches of thought.  So there is no memory of it, for remembrance is always of the past, and meditation is not the resurrection of the past.  It happens out of the fullness of the heart and not out of intellectual brightness and capacity.  It may happen night after night, but each time, if you are so blessed, it is new - not new in being different from old, but new without the background of the old, new in its diversity and changeless change. So sleep becomes a thing of extraordinary importance, not the sleep of exhaustion, not the sleep brought about through drugs and physical satisfaction, but a sleep that is as light and quick as the body is sensitive.  And the body is made sensitive through alertness. Sometimes meditation is as light as a breeze that passes by; at other times its depth is beyond all measure.  But if the mind holds one or the other as a remembrance to be indulged in, then the ecstasy of meditation comes to an end.  It is important never to possess or desire possession of it.  The quality of possessiveness must never enter into meditation, for meditation has no root, nor any substance which the mind can hold.</p>
<p>The other day as we went up the deep canyon which lay in shadow with the arid mountains on both sides, it was full of birds, insects, and the quiet activity of small animals.  You walked up and up the gentle slope to a great height, and from there you watched all the surrounding hills and mountains with the light of the setting sun upon them.  It looked as though they were lit from within, never to be put out.  But as you watched, the light faded, and in the west the evening star became brighter and brighter.  It was a lovely evening, and somehow you felt that the whole universe was there beside you, and a strange quietness surrounded you.</p>
<p>We have no light within ourselves: we have the artificial light of others; the light of knowledge, the light that talent and capacity give.  All this kind of light fades and becomes a pain.  The light of thought becomes its own shadow.  But the light that never fades, the deep, inward brilliance which is not a thing of the market place, cannot be shown to another.  You can't seek it, you can't cultivate it, you can't possibly imagine it or speculate upon it, for it is not within the reach of the mind.</p>
<p>He was a monk of some repute, having lived both in a monastery and alone outside it, seeking, and deeply earnest.</p>
<p>"The things you say about meditation seem true; it is out of reach.  This means, doesn't it, that there must be no seeking, no wishing, no gesture of any kind towards it, whether the deliberate gesture of sitting in a special posture, or the gesture of an attitude towards life or towards oneself?  So what is one to do? What is the point of any words at all?"</p>
<p>You seek out of emptiness, reach out either to fill that emptiness or to escape from it.  This outward movement from inward poverty is conceptual, speculative, dualistic.  This is conflict, and it is endless.  So don't reach out!  But the energy which was reaching out turns from reaching out to reaching inwards, seeking and searching, asking something which it now calls within.  The two movements are essentially the same.  They must both come to an end.</p>
<p>"Are you asking us simply to be content with this emptiness?"</p>
<p>Certainly not.</p>
<p>"So the emptiness remains, and a settled kind of despair.  The despair is even greater if one may not even seek!"</p>
<p>Is it despair if you see the truth that the inward and outward movement have no meaning?  Is it contentment with what is?  Is it the acceptance of this emptiness?  It is none of these.  So: you have dispelled the going out, the coming in, the accepting.  You have denied all movement of the mind that is faced with this emptiness. Then the mind itself is empty, for the movement is the mind itself. The mind is empty of all movement, therefore there is no entity to initiate any movement.  Let it remain empty.  Let it be empty.  The mind has purged itself of the past, the future and the present; it has purged itself of becoming, and becoming is time.  So there is no time; there is no measurement.  Then is it emptiness? "This state comes and goes often.  Even if it is not emptiness, it is certainly not the ecstasy of which you speak."</p>
<p>Forget what has been said.  Forget also that it comes and goes. When it comes and goes it is of time; then there is the observer who says, "It is here, it has gone".  This observer is the one who measures, compares, evaluates, so it is not the emptiness of which we are talking.</p>
<p>"Are you anaesthetizing me?" And he laughed.</p>
<p>When there is no measurement and no time, is there a frontier or an outline to emptiness?  Then can you ever call it emptiness or nothingness?  Then everything is in it, and nothing is in it.</p>
