<p>Please, sit with your faces to the fire, as I shall not talk very long. There will be no music after I have talked and the camp fire will be over soon as I have talked.</p>
<p>You know, we all want to take what we have understood to help another, to bring a change into the world. I feel we cannot change the world with that attitude. If you have understood what I have been talking about during the last three weeks, by your action born of understanding you will bring about a change. Not when you desire to change the world, will you bring a change in the world. But if we act out of understanding, that action will bring about its own change. There is a vast difference between the desire to change, and action born of understanding which brings about change.</p>
<p>Some of you have listened with great earnestness and others have merely heard, and those of you who have really understood and therefore will act, will bring about a change; they will carry the flame. However little it is, it will be the vital flame that will give sustenance, that will be understanding. And you can only carry that flame if you have really searched out and you have really pondered over what has been said during these three weeks. From that, natural action comes; and that action wonâ€™t be the action of patchwork, changing little things here and little things over there. It will be a fundamental change.</p>
<p>I hope you all will have a happy journey and that we shall meet again in two years.</p>
