<p>Life is, from birth to death, a constant strife and pain, a constant battle with oneself and so with one's neighbor. Is this battle necessary, or is there a different approach? Life, existence, is a constant process of becoming, from what is to something else. Becoming is always a strife; becoming is always repetitious; becoming is cultivation of memory. This cultivation of memory is called righteousness, and righteousness is a process of self-enclosure. We know the battle of being poor and of becoming rich, of being petty, small, and of becoming profound. Becoming is the cultivation of memory, and without memory there is no becoming. This struggle is considered righteous, and so righteousness is a form of self-enclosure, self-isolation. To this struggle we have given significance; we have accepted it as a worthwhile, a noble part of our existence, this battle of suffering.</p>
<p>Is life meant to be a process of struggle, sorrow, and pain? Surely, there must be a different way of living. This new way of living can be understood only when we understand the full significance of becoming. In becoming, there is always repetition and the creation of habit. In becoming, there is the cultivation of memory, which lays emphasis on the self. The self, in its very nature, is travail and is contradictory.</p>
<p>Virtue is never a becoming; virtue is being in which there is no strife. You cannot become virtuous, you are or are not virtuous. You can always become righteous, but never become virtuous. Virtue becomes freedom, and a righteous man is never free. If you attempt to be virtuous, you merely become righteous. In understanding the process of becoming, in which there is strife and pain, there is being, which is virtue. In the freedom of virtue, truth comes into being. Truth can never come to the righteous man, for he is enclosed in his becoming. If you try to become merciful, generous, then the emphasis is laid on becoming, on the self, the 'me'. The 'me' can never be merciful. It can enclose itself in righteousness, but it can never be merciful. A righteous man can never be a virtuous man.</p>
<p>If you are aware of the way of virtue, you will see that there is no building up of resistance. Mercy, generosity, self-confidence, freedom from envy do not come into being through the cultivation of virtue. When virtue is cultivated it becomes a resistance, but if you are aware of the process of becoming, which is to understand the ways of the self, then there comes being.</p>
<p>How is one who is caught in the struggle of becoming to step out of it? All that can be done is to be alert and passively aware of this process of becoming. Becoming is to set up resistance, and resistance is the cultivation of memory, which is righteousness. Be aware without choice, without condemnation, and you will find that the wall of resistance drops away. Then only, in freedom, can truth come into being.</p>
<p>Being is virtuous; being brings order and freedom. The man of will, which is, the man of resistance, by his self-enclosing action, is never free, and so truth can never come into being. It is only by the recognition of what is without choice and condemnation, and following its movement swiftly and easily, that freedom from what is comes into being. It is in the understanding of what is that truth is revealed.</p>
<p>Questioner: Are not religious symbols an explanation of a reality too deep to be false? The simple name of God moves us as nothing else. Why should we shun it?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Symbols surely exist as a means of communication. Do we need symbols to communicate with reality? Reality cannot communicate itself to us when our mind is crowded with the means of communication which are symbols - either the cross, the crescent, or the Hindu symbols.</p>
<p>Why is it not possible to experience directly that which is without the intermediary of symbols? Are not symbols, to a man who is seeking a direct experience, a distraction? What happens when you have symbols? Each group of people has its own symbols, and these symbols become more important than the search for reality. The symbol is not the real, the word is not the thing, the word is not God. But the word has become important. Why? Is it not because we are not seeking that which is above and beyond the creations of man? So, symbols have become important and we are willing to destroy each other for them.</p>
<p>The word God gives us a certain stimulation. But we think that stimulation, nervous as well as verbal, has some relation with the real. But has a sensation, which is a thought process, any relation to reality? Has thought, which is the outcome of memory, response to a conditioning, any relationship to reality? So, has a symbol, which is the creation of the mind, any relationship to reality? Is not a symbol a fanciful distraction from reality? For the real to be, the symbol has to be discarded, but we crowd our minds with symbols because we have not got the other. If you love you don't want the symbol of love. If you have the symbol, the picture, the ideal, then you do not love.</p>
<p>Why is it not possible to appreciate things directly? You love a tree or a person not because of what it represents, not because it is a manifestation of life or reality, not because it is an outward expression of an inward state - which are easy explanations. When one is able to love life, not because it is the manifestation of something, then in that very love of life one will find what is real. If you treat life as a manifestation of something, then you abominate life, then you want to run away from life; or you make of life a bore and a routine which make you escape from the actual.</p>
<p>A mind that is caught in symbols is not a simple mind. Only a simple mind, unpolluted, and a clear heart, uncorrupted, can find the real. A mind and a heart caught in words and phrases, in patterns of action, are never free for the real to be. It is only when the mind strips itself of all its accumulations that the real can come into being.</p>
<p>Questioner: What do you advise us to do when war breaks out?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Instead of seeking advice, may I suggest that we examine the problem together? To follow the advice of another in moments of crisis leads to our own destruction; whereas, if we were able to understand the whole implication of war, then we would be able to act truly for ourselves. We would not act according to our conditioning, and that conditioning is strengthened through propaganda and by various other means to impress upon us the necessity of going to war. As we are now conditioned by the so-called love of the country, by economic frontiers, by ideologies - religious or political - we will inevitably jump to arms. To such people, there is no problem; their action is definite and clear-cut; it is called duty and responsibility, and they become the cannon fodder.</p>
<p>You have a problem only when you begin to question the causes of war, which are not merely economic, as some would like to make out, but much more psychological. War is only a bloody and a spectacular projection of your daily life. War comes into being only when you, in your relationship with another, breed conflict, which is the result of your inward strife and misery. This is projected outwardly as antisocial action, and causes disaster and misery. Through greed, acquisitiveness, and envy you are killing, destroying, and maiming thousands. So, when you begin to inquire into the causes of war, you are beginning to understand your relationship with another, you are questioning your whole way of living. According to this inquiry, intelligent or superficial, you will respond when war comes. A man who is nonviolent - who is not the idealist who is striving to become nonviolent - to him war is a great disaster and not productive of peace. So, he will not enter it naturally; he may be shot or he may be imprisoned. He will naturally disregard the consequences.</p>
<p>The idealist, as I have previously explained, is incapable of being free from violence. As your life is based on conflict and violence, if you do not understand that way of life now, how can you act tomorrow with understanding when there is a calamity? How can you, who have been conditioned by nationalism, by class security, by envy, be free of your conditioning at the moment of war? You have to free yourself from these causes of disaster before war comes into being.</p>
<p>War breeds its irresponsibility, and many like this freedom from responsibility. The government will feed you and your family and so on. War gives you an escape from the boring routine of your daily life. It is an ugly business, killing, but at least it is exciting. Also, war acts as a release to criminal instincts. We are criminals in our daily life - in the world of business, in our relationships - but it is all very carefully hidden, covered over with a righteous blanket and legalized. War gives a release from this hypocrisy, and at last we can be openly violent. So, it depends upon your conditioning, how you will act when you are called to arms. But those of us who are earnest, if we can understand how we are violent in our daily life and understand it by actually facing it, if we can be aware of violence in our speech, in our thoughts, in our feelings, and in our actions, we will see that when war comes, we shall be able to act truly.</p>
<p>It is only by being aware of what is and not trying to transform it, trying to make it into something else, that understanding comes. A man who is pursuing an ideal will act falsely because his response will be based on frustration. If you are aware of your daily thoughts and actions without choice and condemnation or justification, then you will be free from those causes that bring about war.</p>
<p>Questioner: Can a man who abhors violence take part in the government of a country?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Government, if it is not completely authoritarian, is supposed to represent you. You elect those who are like you. So, government in a so-called democracy is what you are. What are you? You are a mass of conditioned responses of violence, greed, acquisitiveness, desire for power, and so on. So, the government is what you are. How can a man who has really no violence in his being belong to a structure which is violent?</p>
<p>Can a man who is seeking reality, or to whom reality has come, have anything to do with a government, with a country, with an ideology, with party politics, with systems of power? How can a man who has given himself over to another, whatever it is - to a party, to an ideology, to a guru - find the real? He cannot.</p>
<p>You ask this question about government because you like to rely on outside authority, on the alteration of environmental influences for the transformation of yourself. You hope that leaders, governments, ideologies, systems - which are patterns of action - will somehow transform, bring about order and peace in your lives. Surely, this is the basis of your question. Can another - be it a government, a guru, or an ideology - give you peace and order? Can another give you love and happiness? Certainly not. Peace can only come into being when confusion, which you bring about, is completely understood. But without understanding the causes of our misery, you look to some outward agency to bring you peace and happiness. The outward is always overcome by the inner, and as long as the psychological conflict in various forms exists, however well built and orderly the outer structure, the inward conflict and confusion will always overcome it.</p>
<p>So, without isolating yourself, the transformation must begin - not in opposition to the outer - but to bring, not only to yourself and so to the outer, peace and happiness.</p>
<p>Questioner: You don't seem to think that we have won our independence. According to you, what would be the state of real freedom?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Freedom becomes an isolation when it is nationalistic, when it is exclusive, and when it is class-ridden. Isolation inevitably leads to conflict, for nothing can exist in isolation. To be is to be related.</p>
<p>To isolate yourself in a national frontier invites confusion, starvation, and so on. Independence as a process of isolation ever leads to conflict and war. Independence with most of us implies isolation. When you have isolated yourself as a national entity, have you gained freedom? Have you gained freedom from exploitation, from class struggle, from starvation, from priests, from leaders? Obviously you have not. You have driven out the white exploiter and the brown has taken his place. Both are ruthless.</p>
<p>You do not want to be free. You fool yourself with words. Freedom implies intelligence - intelligence not to exploit, but to be merciful and generous and not to accept authority as a form of security. Virtue is necessary for freedom, but righteousness is an isolating process. Isolation and righteousness always go together. Virtue and freedom are co-existent.</p>
<p>A group of people calling themselves a nation will build self-enclosing walls of isolation and so can never be free. It becomes the cause of strife, suspicion, antagonism, ultimately leading to war. Freedom must begin with the individual, which is a total process, a total process of man. If he isolates himself in economic frontiers or in righteousness, he is the cause of disaster and misery. If he liberates himself from greed and violence, then he will have direct action upon the world of his relationship. This regeneration of the individual is not in the future, but now. If you postpone, you are inviting the wave of darkness and confusion. You will understand only when you give your full attention, when you give your mind and heart to that which needs immediate comprehension.</p>
<p>Questioner: My mind is restless and distressed. Without getting it under control, I can do nothing about myself. How am I to control thought?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: First we must understand thought and the thinker. What do we mean by thought, by thinking? Is the thinker different from his thoughts? Is the meditator different from his meditation? Are the qualities different from the self? Before thought can be controlled, whatever that may mean, we must understand the thinker and his thoughts. Does the thinker exist when he ceases to think? When there are no thoughts, is there the thinker? If there is no thought, there is no thinker. But why is there the division between the thinker and his thoughts? Is this division real or is it fictitious? - this fiction which the mind has created for its own security. We must be very clear if the thinker is separate from his thought and why he has separated himself. Are you not aware that your thoughts are separate from yourself? From this arises the idea that there are the controller and the controlled, the observer and the observed.</p>
<p>Most of you think that the thinker is separate, the higher self dominating the lower self, and so on. Why is there this separation? Is not this separation still in the field of the mind? When you say that the thinker is the atma, the watcher, and the thoughts are separate, surely it is still within the field of the thought process. Does not this division exist because the thinker gives himself permanency through the division? He can always modify his thoughts, put a new frame round him, but he remains apart and thereby gives himself permanency. The thinker without thought is not. He may separate himself. If he ceases to think, he is not. This separation of the thinker from his thought gives permanency to him. The thinker perceives that thoughts are transient, and so he cunningly makes himself permanent by calling himself the atma, the soul, the spiritual entity. But, if you observe closely, putting aside all the acquisitive knowledge of what others have said, however great, you will perceive that the observer is the observed, that there is only thought. There is no thinker apart from the thought. However wisely, deeply, and extensively he may separate himself, build a wall between himself and his thought, he is still within the field of thought. So, the thinker is the thought.</p>
<p>When you ask how thought can be controlled, you put a wrong question. When the thinker begins to control his thoughts, he is merely controlling them in order to give himself continuity, or because he finds his thoughts painful. When you become fully aware of the fact that the thinker is the thought, then you are no longer thinking in terms of dominating or modifying, controlling or channeling your thoughts. Then thought becomes more important than the thinker; then the understanding of the thought process is the beginning of meditation, which is self-knowledge. Without self-knowledge, there is no meditation, and meditation of the heart is understanding.</p>
<p>So, we are concerned with the thought process itself. We are free from the idea of discipline and from the idea of control of thought, which is a great revolution. There is a freedom only when you see the falseness that a thinker is separate from his thought. When you see the truth of the false, then there is freedom from the false.</p>
<p>Thought is the result of sensation and the mind is the recorder, the accumulating factor. Consciousness is experiencing, naming, and recording - which I have explained previously. This recording is memory. Challenge is always new and response is the old, so memory, which is the record of the past, meets the new. This meeting of the new by the old is called experience. Memory has no life in itself. It revivifies itself by meeting the new. The new is giving life to the old, which is to strengthen the old. In translating the new according to its own conditioning, memory comes to life. Memory has life only as it meets the new. This revivification is called thinking. Thinking can never be new, for thinking is the response of memory, which is vitalized by the new. Thinking can never be creative, for it is always the response of memory.</p>
<p>A controlled mind is not a free mind. As thoughts wander all over the place, how is it possible to bring order out of this confusion? To understand a fast-revolving machine it must be slowed down. If you stop it, it is a dead thing and a dead thing can never be understood. So, a mind that has killed thought by exclusion, by isolation, can have no understanding, but a thought can be understood if its process is slowed down. If you have a slow-motion picture of a horse jumping a hurdle, you will see in detail the marvelous movement of the muscles. Similarly, when the mind is slowed down, it can understand each thought as it arises; then only there is freedom from thinking, not controlled or disciplined thought.</p>
<p>Only in meeting the new as the new, the fresh as the fresh, is there creative being. So long as the mind is a recorder, the gatherer of memories which are vivified by challenge, thought process must go on. To be aware of each thought is arduous, but if you are interested in thinking out one thought fully, you might experiment in putting down on paper the thoughts as they arise; by observing them after they are written down, you will find that your mind has slowed down without discipline, without compulsion. Thus, the mind is free from the past and the mind becomes tranquil for it is no longer the creator of problems. Into this tranquillity reality comes into being.</p>
