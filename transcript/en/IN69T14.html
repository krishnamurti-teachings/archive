<p>He was an old monk, revered by many thousands.  He had kept his body well, his head was shaven and he wore the usual saffron-coloured sannyasi robe.  He carried a big stick which had seen many seasons, and a pair of sand-shoes, rather worn out.  We sat on a bench overlooking the river, high up, with the railway bridge to our right and the river winding down round a big curve to our left.  The other side of the bank, that morning, was in a heavy mist, and you could just see the tops of the trees.  It was as though they were floating on the extended river.  There was not a breath of air, and the swallows were flying low near the water's edge.  That river was very old and sacred, and people came from very far to die on its banks and to be burnt there.  It was worshipped, praised in chants and held most sacred.  Every kind of filth was thrown into it; people bathed in it, drank it, washed their clothes in it; you saw people on the banks meditating, their eyes closed, sitting very straight and still.  It was a river that gave abundantly, but man was polluting it.  In the rainy season it would rise from twenty to thirty feet, carry away all the filth, and cover the land with silt which gave nourishment to the peasants along its bank.  It came down in great curves, and sometimes you would see whole trees going by, uprooted by the strong current.  You would also see dead animals, on which were perched vultures and crows, fighting with each other, and occasionally an arm or a leg or even the whole body of some human being.</p>
<p>That morning the river was lovely, there was not a ripple on it. The other bank seemed far away.  The sun had been up for several hours and the mist had not yet gone, and the river, like some mysterious being, flowed on.  The monk was very familiar with that river; he had spent many years on its banks, surrounded by his disciples, and he took it almost for granted that it would be there always, that as long as man lived it would live also.  He had got used to it, and therein lay the pity of it.  Now he looked at it with eyes that had seen it many thousands of times.  One gets used to beauty and to ugliness, and the freshness of the day is gone.</p>
<p>"Why are you," he asked, in a rather authoritative voice, "against morality, against the scriptures which we hold most sacred? Probably you have been spoilt by the West where freedom is licentiousness and where they do not even know, except the few, what real discipline means.  Obviously you have not read any of our sacred books.  I was here the other morning when you were talking and I was rather aghast at what you were saying about the gods, the priests, the saints and the gurus.  How can man live without any of these?  If he does, he becomes materialistic, worldly, utterly brutal, You seem to deny all the knowledge that we hold most sacred.  Why?  I know you are serious.  We have followed you from a distance for many years. We have watched you as a brother.  We thought you belonged to us. But since you have renounced all these things we have become strangers, and it seems a thousand pities that we are walking on different paths."</p>
<p>What is sacred?  Is the image in the temple, the symbol, the word, sacred?  Where does sacredness lie?  In that tree, or in that peasant-woman carrying that heavy load?  You invest sacredness, don't you, in things you consider holy, worthwhile, meaningful?  But what value has the image, carved by the hand or by the mind?  That woman, that tree, that bird, the living things, seem to have but a passing importance for you.  You divide life into that which is sacred and that which is not, that which is immoral and that which is moral. This division begets misery and violence.  Either everything is sacred, or nothing is sacred.  Either what you say, your words, your thoughts, your chants are serious, or they are there to beguile the mind into some kind of enchantment, which becomes illusion, and therefore not serious at all.  There is something sacred, but it is not in the word, not in the statue or in the image that thought has built. He looked rather puzzled and not at all sure where this was leading, so he interrupted: "We are not actually discussing what is and what is not sacred, but rather, one would like to know why you decry discipline?"</p>
<p>Discipline, as it is generally understood, is conformity to a pattern of silly political, social or religious sanctions.  This conformity implies, doesn't it, imitation, suppression, or some form of transcendence of the actual state?  In this discipline there is obviously a continuous struggle, a conflict that distorts the quality of the mind.  One conforms because of a promised or hoped-for reward. One disciplines oneself in order to get something.  In order to achieve something one obeys and submits, and the pattern - whether it be the Communist pattern, the religious pattern or one's own - becomes the authority.  In this there is no freedom at all. Discipline means to learn; and learning denies all authority and obedience.  To see all this is not an analytical process.  To see the implications involved in this whole structure of discipline is itself discipline, which is to learn all about this structure.  And the learning is not a matter of gathering information, but of seeing the structure and the nature of it immediately.  That is true discipline, because you are learning, and not conforming.  To learn there must be freedom.</p>
<p>"Does this imply," he asked, "that you do just what you want? That you disregard the authority of the State?"</p>
<p>Of course not, sir.  Naturally you have to accept the law of the State or of the policeman, until such law undergoes a change.  You have to drive on one side of the road, not all over the road, for there are other cars too, so one has to follow the rule of the road. If one did exactly what one liked - which we surreptitiously do anyway - there would be utter chaos; and that is exactly what there is.  The businessman, the politician and almost every human being is pursuing, under cover of respectability, his own secret desires and appetites, and this is producing chaos in the world.  We want to cover this up by passing laws, sanctions, and so on.  This is not freedom.  Throughout the world there are people who have sacred books, modern or ancient.  They repeat from them, put them into song, and quote them endlessly, but in their hearts they are violent, greedy, searching for power.  Do these so-called sacred books matter at all?  They have no actual meaning.  What matters is man's utter selfishness, his constant violence, hate and enmity - not the books, the temples, the churches, the mosques.</p>
<p>Under the robe the monk is frightened.  He has his own appetites, he is burning with desire, and the robe is merely an escape from this fact.</p>
<p>In transcending these agonies of man we spend our time quarrelling about which books are more sacred than others, and this is so utterly immature.</p>
<p>"Then you must also deny tradition....  Do you?"</p>
<p>To carry the past over to the present, to translate the movement of the present in terms of the past, destroys the living beauty of the present.  This land, and almost every land, is burdened with tradition, entrenched in high places and in the village hut.  There is nothing sacred about tradition, however ancient or modern.  The brain carries the memory of yesterday, which is tradition, and is frightened to let go, because it cannot face something new. Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay.  One must take the journey unburdened, sweetly, without any effort, never stopping at any shrine, at any monument, or for any hero, social or religious - alone with beauty and love.</p>
<p>"But we monks are always alone, aren't we?" he asked.  "I have renounced the world and taken a vow of poverty and chastity."</p>
<p>You are not alone, sir, because the very vow binds you - as it does the man who takes the vow when he gets married.  If we may point out, you are not alone because you are a Hindu, just as you would not be alone if you were a Buddhist, or a Muslim, or a Christian or a Communist.  You are committed, and how can a man be alone when he is committed, when he has given himself over to some form of ideation, which brings its own activity?  The word itself, "alone," means what it says - uninfluenced, innocent, free and whole, not broken up.  When you are alone you may live in this world but you will always be an outsider.  Only in aloneness can there be complete action and co-operation; for love is always whole.</p>
