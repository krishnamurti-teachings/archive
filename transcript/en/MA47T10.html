<p>Right thinking is essential to dissolve the many problems with which we are confronted each day. It is important to find out how to think rightly, how to understand the problems rightly rather than what should be the thought and attitude regarding the problem. We are accustomed to be told what to think about the problem and not how to think about it. How to think is essential, not what to think. To seek a mere solution to a problem brings about wrong thinking, and right thinking comes about in understanding the problem, what is. Right action can take place only with right thinking, and right thinking comes with self-knowledge.</p>
<p>What is thinking? I wonder if we have ever asked ourselves that question. What is the process of thinking? It would be good if we could talk this over together, but as that is not possible with such a large audience, nevertheless, I hope you will partake silently in what is being said. This is a discourse in which both you and I are taking part; if you allow yourself to become the mere listeners, then real communication between us ceases. Communion between us can exist only when our hearts are open to each other. Do not let us close our hearts with verbal misunderstandings and prejudices.</p>
<p>What is thinking, the process of thinking? As we know it, it is a response of memory, is it not? Memory is the accumulation or residue of experience. So thinking, which is the response of memory, is always conditioned. You have an experience and you respond to it or interpret it according to your background, memories, the residue of previous experiences. This response of memory is called thinking. Such thinking only strengthens conditioning, which only produces more conflict and sorrow. The constant response of the residue of experience is called thinking. Life is a series of challenges and responses but the response is conditioned and this response of memory is called thinking. But the challenge is ever new and the response is of the past.</p>
<p>Believing is not thinking, believing is only conditioned response, which is binding, causing conflict and sorrow. According to your belief, background, conditioning, you experience; this experiencing leads only to further conditioned thinking. The so-called thinking, the response to challenge which is ever new, is limited, within the frame of reference, memory, and so brings further conflict, further confusion, and further sorrow. This so-called thinking is not really thinking, but what, then, is thinking? The response of memory to challenge is not thinking.</p>
<p>Have you ever asked yourself what you mean by thinking? What is thinking? As it is a new question put to you, a new challenge, what is your response to it? Since you have not thought about it, what is your immediate response? You are silent, are you not? Please follow this with a little care. A new problem is presented to you; and since you have not ''thought'' about it - that is, since there is as yet no response of the frame of reference, memory - there is a natural, unforced hesitancy, a quietness, a stillness of observation. Is that not so? You are silently watching, you are not interpreting the new problem according to the frame of reference, memory, but your mind is very alert, one-pointed, without effort, and as the question is vital, your mind is not asleep, alert but passive. The mind is alertly passive, awaiting the true answer to the problem.</p>
<p>Now, this alert yet passive state is true thinking; right thinking comes with the ending of the response of memory. Since it is confronted with a new problem, your mind is still, quiet but not dull, asleep, alertly aware but passive. It is not active for it is not even seeking an answer, for it does not know it. This state of alert, passive awareness is thinking, is it not? It is the highest form of thinking, there is neither positive nor negative response of memory.</p>
<p>Now, is it not possible to meet our every human problem with this ever new, alert, passive awareness? When we do, then the problem yields its full significance and thereby comes to an end. But when we try to solve the problem by thinking about it, which is to follow the response of the memory, modified or unchanged, then we further complicate the problem by interpreting it according to our conditioning, and so bring about further conflict and sorrow. You can experiment with this for yourself. Take any problem that you have, any vital and intimate problem; put aside your conditioned responses and look at the problem anew. This passive, alert awareness is the highest form of thinking; this awareness dissolves our problems with their conflicts and pain.</p>
<p>Questioner: I dream a great deal. Have dreams any significance?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: When are we awake? When there is a crisis, when there is an intense problem, either of pleasure or of pain; the problem is an awakening, but our instinctive desire is to escape from it through so many different ways, and thereby we put ourselves to sleep once again. When there is a problem, what is your response to it? You try to solve it according to the frame of reference, according to some principle, to some teachings which only put you to sleep again. So when there is a pleasurable challenge you pursue it, craving more of it, which only dulls the mind and heart, putting you to sleep again; when the challenge causes pain you avoid it, which only helps to dull the mind and heart. Challenge demands earnest attention, clear perception, and understanding, which may necessitate further action; but we refuse, or so identify with the problem that sleep is induced. This is generally what happens to us and only very rarely are we awake. In those rare moments there is no dream; in those moments of full wakefulness there is neither the dream nor the dreamer, experience nor the gatherer of experience.</p>
<p>What is the significance of dreams? During the so-called wakeful state, during the day, the conscious mind is actively engaged in earning a livelihood, occupied with some complicated technical job, learning, wrangling, avoiding, enjoying, or with prayer and worship. It is constantly and superficially active, but when it goes to bed the surface mind becomes fairly quiet. But consciousness is not just the superficial layer. Consciousness has many layers: layers of hidden motives, pursuits, fears, and so on. These hidden layers project themselves into the now peaceful, superficial layer, the conscious mind, which, upon waking, is aware that there was a dream. The conscious mind is so occupied with its daily activities that it is incapable of receiving during the day the intimations, the hints, of the hidden layers. Only when the superficial layer, the conscious mind, becomes quiet, then the deeper layers can project themselves. These projections, with their symbols, become dreams. There are dreams without consequence and dreams with significance. The dreams that are the outcome of bodily weariness, of indulgence, of ailments, and so on, we are not here considering.</p>
<p>Dreams are the intimations of the deeper layers of consciousness. The conscious mind receives these intimations through symbols, through pictures, which need translation, interpretation. I do not know if you have noticed that as the dream proceeds there is also at the same time an interpretation of what is taking place. Dreams demand interpretation, that is, if you are at all aware, you want to know their significance. There is the luxury of going to a psychoanalyst, the dream interpreter who will unravel it for you after many months, for a great deal of money. But most of us have neither the money nor are we near one. They will become the new priests if we are not wise; we will exploit them and they will exploit us, which is a most unfortunate factor in human relationship.</p>
<p>You have had a dream of some significance; you want to understand it; you are anxious about it. You try to interpret it, and your interpretation of it will be according to your prejudices, fears, and so on. According to your likes and dislikes, you translate your dream and so miss its full significance. The interpreter is too anxious, too agitated, and so he cannot fully understand his dream. Only when the interpreter is alert and yet passively aware, choicelessly watchful, then only does the dream yield its full meaning. So the dream is not so important as the dreamer, the interpreter. He is of greater significance. In understanding himself, he is then open to all the hidden layers of consciousness and so frees himself from conflict and sorrow.</p>
<p>As long as the interpreter exists, he must always dream and be anxious about his interpretations. Is it necessary to dream? Dreams come to an end only when the conscious mind is alert and passively aware during the waking hours, so that the hidden layers can give their intimation without being misinterpreted; it is possible only when the conscious mind is not entangled in the conflict of problems, when it is still and not made still; it is possible only when there is integration of all the layers of consciousness so that the superficial layer is the profound. If you will experiment you will see that though the superficial layer is occupied with outward activities, yet because it is choicelessly aware, the intimations, the projections, as they arise, of the hidden layers, are being understood. Thus there is a freedom, an integration of the different and separate parts of consciousness. Only when there is an understanding of the different parts of consciousness, and thereby a complete integration of the parts, then only the dreamer ceases to dream. For dreams are a disturbance, and when these disturbances stop, then only can consciousness penetrate deeply, beyond itself. When there is no disturbance, then on waking there is a renewal; there is always an ending, so there is always the ecstasy of renewal.</p>
<p>As the fields are allowed to lie fallow after they are tilled, sown, and harvested, so must the conscious mind allow itself to be passively aware. As the field renews itself when allowed to lie fallow, so does the mind renew itself. This creative renewal must take place from moment to moment. When you have a problem you struggle with it, not completely understanding it, and so carry it over to the next day. There is never an ending, but continuity is strengthened. Only in ending is there a renewal, and in continuity there is sorrow. To live the four seasons in a moment is to be blessed with the ecstasy of renewal. It is not the renewal of desire with its endless conflicts and pains, but a rebirth of the ever new, of the ever fresh.</p>
<p>Questioner: We see the significance of what you say, but there are many important problems which demand immediate attention, such as the struggle between capital and labor.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Now, either we deal with problems with the reformist mind, seeking an immediate solution, which only breeds further problems and further reforms, or approach the problem as the end of a total process, which demands right thinking. So, how are you approaching the problem, as a reformer, in its widest sense, or as a seeker after truth? It is very important to be clear what your approach is. If you are concerned with mere immediate reform, solution, then it will inevitably lead to more conflict, more confusion, more sorrow. This attitude, that of the politician, that of the man committed to a system, causes disaster and misery. Or are you considering the problems of daily existence - starvation, economic frontiers, the struggle of capital and labor, and so on - from the point of view of a man who is seeking the whole meaning of existence?</p>
<p>The individual or the group craving for power and position leads to every kind of corruption and disaster, socially and psychologically. Whether power, violence, is used in the name of the state or in the name of religion, it cannot possibly bring about order and peace in the world; on the contrary, it will breed multiple miseries. Power, exercised by a government of the right or of the left, in the name of the people or of a system, will not give man even his physical security. Without understanding the true meaning of existence, to merely organize society according to any particular pattern is to cultivate conflict, confusion, misery. To merely encourage revolution, to carry out a particular system of thought, is to be utterly indifferent to man's struggle and misery.</p>
<p>Must we not consider the total process of man and not take one issue and try to solve it separately? This process is more psychological than mere material struggle; the hidden conflicts and confusion always shadow the outer existence, and without comprehending inner issues, to merely regulate outward events is the work of the thoughtless; and the reformer and the politician are involved in this superficial activity. Such activity breeds more conflict, more confusion, more misery, which is exactly what is taking place at the present time. Without understanding man's relationship to man, there can be no happiness for him in any system nor in any immediate reform. Right relationship between man and man cannot be brought about by mere legislation, nor by mere social controls. Right relationship can exist only when you understand yourself; for what you are the world is; your problem is the world's problem. You cannot bring order and peace in the world without first bringing, through self-knowledge, order and peace within yourself. You must begin with yourself and not with a society which you have created. Your relationship with another is society, and according to your thoughts and actions, you bring about misery or happiness.</p>
<p>Questioner: Are we not shaped by circumstances? Are we not the creatures of our senses?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: The implications in this question are profound and we must consider them thoughtfully. We are shaped by circumstances, but there is surely greater significance to life than mere sensate values. The discovery of what is beyond the sensory values lies through self-knowledge. Without self-knowledge, all knowledge leads to misery and to illusion. Without self-knowledge, there is no foundation for right thinking and right action; without self-knowledge life is a contradiction and despair.</p>
<p>There is the idea that matter is in movement in itself, and the other formulation is that God or idea moves upon matter. The one is supposed to be materialistic and the other so-called religious. The materialistic formulation implies the control of environment as a means of shaping, controlling the individual, and so he is not important in himself. So circumstances, environmental influence, outward and scientific knowledge become all-important. It is essentially based on sensate value. The religious formulation admits of an absolute value, that the individual is sacred, an end in himself, not a mere tool in the hands of the state, and so on. The materialist, the extreme leftist says that there is no absolute value, that man is merely the product of the senses and of environmental influence, and he changes his values according to sensory demands. So the control of environment, of matter, of the individual, becomes all-important, shaping him according to a system, compelling him to shape himself according to a pattern of thought, so that he functions effectively in a mechanized society. To understand, do not take sides nor be on the defensive; understanding comes with freedom and not with a biased intelligence.</p>
<p>To the so-called religious, the individual is all-important, for he is created in the image of the idea; in him the absolute value exists, which is translated in multiple ways; he is a spiritual entity, fashioning his own end, and so utilizing the environment for that purpose, and hence environment is not all-important. We need not enlarge and explain further the religious point of view.</p>
<p>Both these formulations are theories, beliefs; both have their sacred books, both have their propagandistic organizations, both have their high priests, their central authority, their binding dogma and discipline, their future hope and the way to realize it, and so forth. Both meet in moments of grave crisis, national or economic disaster. To the religious, the individual is sacred only so long as there is no danger to his state or to his system; when there is, the individual is sacrificed to war, to be regimented and controlled by the state and so on.</p>
<p>So the materialist and the religious are both approaching the problem with a prejudiced mind, a mind conditioned by a belief, by a dogma. But to find truth, we must be free from belief and dogma. Obviously, one of the facts is that man is the result of environmental influences; man is the result of his sensory cravings; his relationship with another, based on sensate value, creates society of which you and I are the product. When you call yourself a Hindu, a Christian, or a Muslim, you are the product of your environment. You are conditioned to believe - and you do - in God or in no-God. You go to the temple or to the church according to your conditioning. Environmental influences, economic and social, have shaped your mind. But to find out if you are only the result of environment, merely the product of matter in movement in itself, or if you are something more, you must go deeper and deeper into the creator of sensate values and go above and beyond thought itself to find truth. Thought is still the result of the senses. You have to experiment with yourself; there must be self-awareness, which is self-knowledge, to discover how deeply your thoughts and feelings are sensory and what is beyond thought. If you accept that which is gratifying, God, then you are akin to the materialist who denies; for denial and acceptance are both hindrances to him who is seeking truth. You are living and experiencing according to your conditioning. But those who are living according to their conditioning, or according to their gratifying or arbitrary decision, will not discover the truth.</p>
<p>If you want to find the truth, you must begin obviously with the senses; in understanding the sensory values, you enter into the question of consciousness; if you pursue further, not verbally but actually, you will discover what is. If you approach a problem from the point of its opposite, then the significance of the problem is not understood, for the opposite is the outcome of its own opposite. Belief or nonbelief cannot be understood if they are treated as opposites; then there are merely responses to a conditioning. When the religious is in opposition to the materialistic, this very belief breeds conflict; the materialist, by his very denial, fosters belief. When the left is treated as an opposite to the right, then the left is the continuation of the right.</p>
<p>In the understanding of what is, ever profoundly, there comes a tranquillity that is not self-induced. When the mind is utterly still, not only in its superficial layers, but in the entire consciousness, when all desire is still, there comes into being that which is real. Acceptance is the very denial of truth.</p>
