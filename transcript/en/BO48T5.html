<p>There is so much sorrow and so little happiness in our life. When there is happiness, the problems of power, position, and achievement disappear. When there is happiness, the struggle to become ceases, and the divisions between man and man come to an end. All conflicts come to an end when there is happiness. Happiness comes only with the highest form of intelligence. Intelligence is the understanding of sorrow; it is not the outcome of sorrow. We know sorrow is always with us, a constant companion, ever increasing, without end. We know sorrow in different forms, physical and psychological.</p>
<p>We know remedies to overcome physical pain; but, psychological pains are more complex, and to seek remedies for these is to avoid the understanding of them, which alone can put an end to pain. The psychological suffering is more complex, demanding greater attention, deeper penetration, and wider experiencing. But sorrow, whatever it be, at whatever level, is still painful and agonizing.</p>
<p>Does suffering come to an end through effort, through thought process? Physical pain can be overcome by a thought process, but the psychological suffering - anxiety, frustration, the innumerable aches - can they be transcended by effort, by thought? So, what is suffering? What is effort? What is thought? If you can understand this problem directly, then you will destroy this ache, this burning loneliness and pain.</p>
<p>What is suffering? Is it not the desire to become, with its varying actions and frustrations that lead to conflict and disintegration? This desire to become, negatively or positively, is sorrow.</p>
<p>Will effort, the action of the will, put an end to sorrow? When there is frustration we try to overcome it, we try to battle against it. This positive action in varying degrees and in multiple forms, positively or negatively, is called effort. Effort exists or comes into being when there is the anxiety to change what is. Change is modified continuity. I am this and I want to become that, the opposite of what I am, but it is still the continuation of what I am in a different form. So, the gaining of the opposite, in which is always effort, is the modified continuity of what is. To become nongreedy is the modified continuity of greed, only under a different name - it is still greed. In the pursuit of the opposite is implied becoming and the becoming is the cause of sorrow.</p>
<p>Can the thought process bring an end to sorrow? What is thinking? Thinking is a response of memory. If there were no memory, there would be no thinking. Memory is the residue of experience which is not completely, fully understood. Only the incomplete experiences leave their mark, which we call memory. So, suffering is not solved through memory. In dealing with sorrow, three things are involved: thought, memory, and effort. As pointed out already, thought cannot resolve sorrow. What can bring about that happiness is not the result of effort - happiness is not a result. It comes into being spontaneously, uninvited. If you seek happiness by getting rid of sorrow, you will not understand sorrow. When you try to resolve sorrow through the thought process, you create the problem of sorrow at a different level. When you use effort to overcome sorrow, you create duality, the opposite; and the opposite is always within the field of its own cause.</p>
<p>What can put an end to sorrow? Sorrow can be understood only when you become aware of the process of thought, of memory, of effort. When you are aware, you are neither condemning nor justifying; condemnation, justification, or identification create a barrier to understanding. When this justification and condemnation disappear, then you are aware, you perceive; there comes an alert passivity. In that awareness, sorrow comes to an end.</p>
<p>Questioner: You say that love is chaste. Does it mean it is celibate?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: To understand any problem there must be no offensive or defensive response. There must be inquiry without bias, without being tethered to tradition or belief. When the mind is tethered, it is tied to an attitude, it cannot be free to discover what is true. If you are anchored to a haven of belief or to a prejudice, you will never find the truth of any problem. So let us inquire together without being anchored to any conclusion - which is in itself an arduous task. Prejudice distorts.</p>
<p>In this question is involved the complex problem of sex. Religion, gurus, and tradition have condemned sex, as it is said that it prevents man from realizing the highest, and that to realize the highest, celibacy is necessary. Tradition and authority must not stand in the way of finding truth; they become a hindrance to a man who is seeking truth. In extremes there is no stability. The opposite is fictitious and truth is not found in it. To understand, there must be no fear, nor the pursuit of pleasure and indulgence.</p>
<p>Why has sex become such an intense, burning problem to most of us? Why is man caught in sensate pleasure? If we do not understand this, mere self-discipline or superficial legislation will not solve this problem. It has become a burning issue because it is stimulated by every possible means in modern society. Newspapers, cinema, and magazines stimulate eroticism. Advertisements, to attract your attention, use the picture of a woman. Outward and inward stimulation is encouraged, is sedulously cultivated. The present society is essentially the outcome of sensate value. Things, power, position, name, and class have become of vital significance. Sensory values have become predominantly significant in your lives. Your emotions and thoughts are imitative and so have ceased to be creative. Your organized religion is mere copy - following authority, tradition, and fear, merely following the example, the ideal. Religion has become routine, religion has become the vain repetition of rituals, practicing of disciplines, the imposition of beliefs which merely breed habit and imitation.</p>
<p>When the mind and heart are caught in copying, they wither. The heart and the mind must be swift and pliable, capable of deep penetration and understanding, but when they are made into a record-playing machine, they cease to be. So, inwardly, there is no creative response, but dullness and emptiness. Your lives are hollow, empty, a routine of earning money, playing cards, going to the cinema, and the reading of books. Such a mind and heart function without depth and compassion. How can such a mind be creative? Since your life is without compassion, without joy, you have only one pleasure left, which is sex; therefore, it becomes an ever increasing problem. Your ideals, your disciplines, will not free you from this problem. You may suppress it, you may hold it down; but suppression is not creative understanding and happiness. There is a constant state of fear without love. Happiness can only come in the state of self-forgetfulness, and sex is used as a means of brief self-forgetfulness.</p>
<p>In understanding this problem fully you will find the answer. To all the major problems of life there is no categorical answer of yes or no. But in understanding the problem clearly, you will find an answer. The answer to this question is that the problem will exist so long as there is no creative understanding, so long as you are not free from copying, from the various forms of psychological habits. It is only in bringing about a radical transformation in your lives, a revolution of values, this question of sex will have a different meaning. Then life itself undergoes a rigorous and deep transformation.</p>
<p>Those who are trying to be celibate in order to achieve God are unchaste for they are seeking a result or gain and so substituting the end, the result, for sex - which is fear. Their hearts are without love, and there can be no purity, and a pure heart alone can find reality. A disciplined heart, a suppressed heart, cannot know what love is. It cannot know love if it is caught in habit, in sensation - religious or physical, psychological or sensate. The idealist is an imitator and therefore he cannot know love. He cannot be generous, give himself over completely without the thought of himself. Only when the mind and heart are unburdened of fear, of the routine of sensational habits, when there is generosity and compassion, there is love. Such love is chaste.</p>
<p>Questioner: You say that this present crisis is without precedent. In what way is it exceptional?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: You are familiar with crises of varying types, at different periods throughout history-social, national, political. Crises come and go. Economic recessions and social depressions get modified and continue in different forms. The present crisis is different because it is in the field of ideation. Now you are all justifying evil as a means to a righteous end. Evil was recognized to be evil, murder as murder; but now, murder is used as a means to a righteous end, and so evil is justified. This justification of evil cannot bring about peace in the world. War is not a means of peace. The sacrifice of the present for the future is considered worthy. The future must ever be uncertain, and to sacrifice the present for the unpredictable, and to justify it, is another form of negation of life. In this is implied the employment of wrong means to achieve a right end, which can never be, for the end is in the means. Means and end are not separate; they are a joint phenomenon, and to separate them is to bring about bloodshed, destruction, and misery.</p>
<p>We have exploited man and his necessities. But now, we are exploiting his ideas, and the exploitation of ideas is more devastating and destructive.</p>
<p>Another indication of this exceptional crisis is that man is forgotten and systems have become all-important. Man is no longer of any significance, but systems are. For a system, millions are destroyed, and the destruction is justified because the system promises a beneficial result. Systems are patterns of action, and actions without understanding the purpose of man cannot be justified, however noble or ignoble they are. Systems cannot solve man's problems. Systems are the outcome of experts and of incomplete knowledge. The specialists give importance to their inventions, but only the integration of the individual can solve the present crisis.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this crisis is the importance that man is giving to sensate values - property and name, caste and country. Values of things, whether made by the hand or by the mind, have become the predominant influence in your lives, and so there is the quick recurrence of wars.</p>
<p>This crisis is exceptional. So, an exceptional action is necessary. As I have said, thought process will not make a man free from this crisis; only the state of being, which is timeless action, must come. This state of being comes with individual transformation. When you transform yourself, you will discover that there is an action which is not productive of a further wave of destruction and misery. So, your regeneration must be timeless, for if you look to tomorrow, you are inviting confusion and sorrow.</p>
<p>Questioner: Are there no perfect gurus who have nothing for the greedy seeker of eternal security, but who guide, visibly or invisibly, their loving hearts?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: This question is put over and over again in different forms - whether a guru is necessary or not. Does a loving heart need a guide? A loving heart needs no guide, for love is its own eternity. A loving heart is generous, merciful, it respects; then, it knows that which is without a beginning, without an end. But most of you have no such heart. Your hearts are dry and empty, filled with the things made by the mind. Being empty, you go to another to have it filled. You go to another to find eternal security which you call God. You go to another to find that permanent gratification which you call peace. Because your hearts are dry, you seek a guru who, you hope, will fill it with the gratification which you call love.</p>
<p>Can anyone free your heart, whether the guru is visible or invisible? Gurus can give patterns of action, they may tell you what to think, but not how to think. They may give you disciplines and words to repeat; but these are things made by the mind and so the heart is ever empty. Your practice, your meditation, your imitations, only make your heart dull and weary, terrorizing your family and yourself. Will you know love through compulsion?</p>
<p>Without love, you cannot find reality. Without being tender, considerate, how can you know the real? Through a technique, love is not captured.</p>
<p>Disciplines and practices, rituals and mere knowledge make for a dull and insensitive mind. A restless mind becomes only a dull mind when it is held within the narrow groove of a discipline. Without sensitivity, this swift movement of truth cannot be discovered.</p>
<p>The pursuit of gurus wastes the pliability of the mind and heart. This constant search for gratification, which you call the search for God, wearies the mind, using it wastefully, for that which is used constantly wears itself out. Since you seek gratification, you will find a guru who is gratifying. But this is not understanding. This does not bring about happiness and there is no love. The search for gratification, calling it by a noble name, only destroys.</p>
<p>Love is ever new. Without its perfume, its beauty and goodness, to search for a guru is a waste of time and action. Where there is love, there is no need for a guru; on the contrary, the guru becomes a hindrance. For, love is virtue; virtue is not a practice; virtue brings freedom. It is only when there is freedom that the eternal comes into being.</p>
<p>So, our problem is how to awaken the dull and the empty heart to the beauty and richness of love. You must be aware your mind is dull, that your thought process has no significance, and that your heart is empty, filled by things made by the mind. Just be aware, passively aware without condemnation, without justification. Be open to discover what is. In this passive yet alert awareness, there comes a transformation. In this stillness, in this tranquillity, the indescribable comes into being.</p>
