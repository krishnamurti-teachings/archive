<p>There is a difference between listening and hearing. Hearing is subjective and listening is objective. If we merely listen to words and do not hear their significance, then these talks will have little meaning. Communication is on the same level at the same time; communion exists only when there is love. Understanding is denied when prejudice shapes our mind and heart. Compartmental thinking is a barrier to happiness. Happiness is not the denial of sorrow, but the understanding of sorrow. The conflict and pain of suffering dulls the mind and the heart. Suffering does not make for intelligence; suffering does not bring comprehension. It is a sign of ignorance to assume that suffering cultivates thought and intelligence. Does suffering bring about understanding? What actually happens to us when we suffer? What do we mean by suffering? A psychological disturbance, superficial or profound, brought about by various causes, as the loss of someone dear, as when there is frustration, when there is no meaning to life, when the present has no meaning, and so either the past or the future becomes important. A life of confusion and contradiction is sorrow; a life of emptiness and ignorance is sorrow; a life of acquisition and ambition is sorrow; a life of sensory values is sorrow.</p>
<p>Now, actually, what happens when you suffer? The instinctive response to sorrow is to escape from it, to take flight from it. We try to run away from sorrow through belief, through formulation and explanation, through rituals and priests, through music and gurus or teachers. The very inquiry into the cause of suffering becomes an intellectual or verbal escape, for if one is aware, one realizes directly the cause; the cause and effect are not distant, they are not separate. The sufferer becomes capable in escapes, efficient in guarding himself against suffering. This cunning, this capacity to escape, is considered to be the cultivation of intelligence; the change of the object of escapes is considered growth. But suffering continues. How is suffering to be understood? Merely to search out its cause does not do away with suffering. Suffering comes with craving, craving expresses itself in many forms: greed and prejudice, worldliness and the desire for continuance, and so on. Mere information concerning the cause and its effect does not do away with suffering.</p>
<p>The more you are acquainted, familiar with suffering, the more you ''love'' it, the more you invite and converse with it, the more it gives you perfume, its significance. If you run away from it through any avenues of escape, religious or scientific, or find substitutions for suffering, suffering invariably continues. Suffering is to be understood and not overcome, for that which is overcome has to be conquered again and again. Suffering can be understood and transcended only through self-knowledge; with self-knowledge comes right thinking. Right thinking does not come into being if there is condemnation or identification. You do not deny beauty and beauty is not the denial of ugliness. If you refuse suffering you also refuse happiness, for happiness is not the opposite of suffering. The understanding of suffering comes with right thinking; through being aware of every thought, feeling, and action, right thinking comes, and only right thinking can dissolve the cause of pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Questioner: I heard your last Sunday's talk about duality and the pain of it. But as you did not explain how to overcome the opposite, will you please go further into the matter?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: We know the conflict of the opposites: we are caught in this long corridor of pain, ever attempting to overcome the opposite. This is our existence, the battle of the opposites: I am this and I want to become that; I am not this and I would like to become that; this constant struggle of the clerk to become the manager, the unvirtuous trying to become the virtuous, and so on. With this process each one is familiar.</p>
<p>Now, does the opposite exist? Only what exists is the actual; but the opposite is the negative response to what is; the opposite is not, but it comes into being with becoming. The opposite is not the actual, but what is; the ideal, positive or negative, is nonexistent, but what is is the actual. In understanding what is is the beginning of freedom. The feeling of arrogance arises which is the actual; the fact and the negative response to this is humility, the ideal, which is not yet in being. Humility, the opposite, is accepted, for arrogance has been condemned morally and socially and religiously, and also from arrogance there is conflict and pain. So there arises the desire to get rid of arrogance, and as it is no longer profitable, humility, the opposite, is sought after. So what is actually taking place is that I am arrogant and I would like to become humble. Humility is an idea and not yet a psychological fact; the actual is arrogance and its opposite is not, but I would like to become humble. So the very desire to become creates the opposite; the opposite is not existent, an ideal to be achieved.</p>
<p>Love is not the opposite of hate; if it is, it ceases to be love. An opposite has the seed of its own opposite: humility, the opposite, is the outcome of arrogance, and so humility has the seed of its opposite. If we begin to understand the very significance of arrogance, without condemning it, without introducing its opposite as a means of denial, then the conflict of duality wholly ceases. What is existent is arrogance, and if I can understand that, then I need not go into the battle of becoming. To put it differently, the present is the result of the past, and without understanding the present, the future becomes merely the opposite of what is, the present. But the future is the past through the passage of the present, and so the future holds the seed of the present; the future as the opposite is still in the net of time. The present is the passage to the future or the past, and in understanding this movement, thought will no longer be caught either in the past or in the future as an opposite to the present. To understand what is, which is arrogance, I must give my whole attention, my whole being, and not be distracted by its opposite.</p>
<p>Why do we name a feeling? Why do we term a reaction as anger, as jealousy, as arrogance, as hate, and so on? Do you term it in order to understand it, or as a means of recognizing it, or to communicate it? Is the feeling independent of the term, or do you understand it through the term? If you understand the feeling through the term, through the word, then the term becomes important and not the feeling. Is it possible not to name the feeling? If it is, then what happens to the feeling? By terming, you entangle the feeling within the frame of reference, and so the living is caught in the net of time, which only strengthens memory, the 'me'. What happens to a feeling, to a response if you do not give a name, a term to it? Does it not come to an end, does it not wither away? Please experiment with this and discover for yourself. Any response to a challenge comes to an end when you do not name it, put it within the frame of reference.</p>
<p>So you have learned now how to get rid of a painful, a sorrowful response. But will you give a name to a feeling that is termed pleasant? When a pleasurable feeling arises and you do not give it a name, it too will die away, wither away. So, pleasurable and painful responses wither away when you do not term them, when they are not absorbed into the frame of reference. Experiment with this and discover for yourself. But is love a response not to be named and so let wither away? It will wither if it is an opposite of hate, for then it is merely a conditioned response to a challenge. If it is merely a reaction, then it is not love. Love is a state of being; it is its own eternity. Most of us are trying to become merciful, generous, kind, and becoming is the result of an opposite, positive or negative. Love is not to be cultivated; if you cultivate mercy it ceases to be mercy, for then it contains its own opposite, hate. Love is when there is no becoming which engenders the opposite.</p>
<p>This conflict of duality, with its confusion and sorrow, is born of thoughtlessness, the lack of right thinking. In understanding the significance of what is, the opposite ceases. The opposite comes into being only when what is, the present, is avoided. Becoming what is not leads to illusion. In understanding what is - arrogance, not only superficially but throughout the deeper layers of consciousness, as achievement, as pride, and so on - and not naming, terming the feeling, then it withers away. The pursuit of the pleasant and the denial of the painful only create conflict and sorrow, dulling the mind and the heart.</p>
<p>Questioner: Gandhi says in a recent article that religion and nationalism are equally dear to man, and one cannot be bartered away in favor of the other. What do you say?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: I wonder what is your own response to this question? Will you question your so-called leaders? Must you not criticize, inquire to find out the truth? Through self-criticism, tribulation is inevitable, and it is easier and more convenient to follow than to be aware and understand. The acceptance of authority is blinding, putting an end to understanding, which alone brings happiness. If alert and self-critical awareness is lost, then discovery of truth is not possible. Therein lies the insidious danger of breeding leaders, religious or political, and following them. Mutual exploitation exists between the follower and the leader. In India, as elsewhere, it is extraordinary to watch the growth of leaders, the tyrants in the name of religion and of systems, and the more power they have, the more evil they become. To search out truth, there must be an open heart and a uncontaminated mind - a mind that is not in bondage to a system, to a belief, to a person. To discover truth, you must venture into the open, uncharted seas. We are not concerned with any particular leader, but with authority itself. Creation is not possible within the frame of authority. Creativeness withers in the heat of authority. You may produce some mechanical responses, but creativeness ceases. This is one of the tragedies of modern civilization. When you give yourself over to another - to a priest, to a political leader, to a savior, to a system, to a belief - then you cease to feel, to live, and as human beings, you are nonexistent. Through the pursuit of authority, your conflicts and sorrows are not resolved.</p>
<p>Now, it is said that religion and nationalism are both dear to man, and one cannot be bartered away for the other. Let's find the truth of this, neither opposing it nor defending it, for truth alone is the liberator, it alone gives happiness. What do you mean by religion? Religion is not the worship of an image made by the hand or by the mind, nor does it consist in going to a temple or church, nor in reading sacred books, nor in repeating words or chants, and to believe is not to be religious.</p>
<p>Religion is the search for reality as God, or what name you will. Organized religions with their beliefs, with their rituals, with their fears and exploitations, are an impediment to the discovery of reality, for they condition the mind and the heart according to their particular pattern. Religion is the search and the discovery of the real, and not the performance of rituals, not the following of a guru, teacher, or savior. The approach to truth must be negative, for positive action is based on the known, and what is known is not the real. Reality is the unknowable, and you cannot come to it through any path, for all paths are the known. Any positive approach to the unknown is not possible, for the positive is the known; truth is when the known ceases. The eternal cannot be approached through time; the timeless is when time ceases, when thought, which is the result of time, comes to an end.</p>
<p>Nationalism is the craving for identification, the attachment to a group, to a race, to a country and so on, is it not? The identification of oneself with the greater - with India, with England, and so on - is the craving for continuance. When you call yourself a Hindu, or a Muslim, or a Christian, is it not an indication that the term, the name, is of greater significance than yourself? The name, the label, covers the poverty of your inner being; you are petty, shallow, and through identification you hope to escape from your own emptiness. So the name, the country, the idea, become all-important, and for that you are willing to die and to kill. This craving for identification is exploited. Nationalism, the economic frontier, inevitably leads to war; nationalism is of recent growth, a poison that is destroying man, setting man against man. Through nationalism, the unity of man is not possible; the nationalist can never comprehend the brotherhood of man. Nationalism is the new religion, and it can only breed hatred and disaster.</p>
<p>Organized religion and nationalism have set man against man, and through them there is no hope for man. They have been the cause of untold misery and degradation. Ignorance does not lead to enlightenment; ignorance must cease so that there can be enlightenment. Organized belief, which is organized religion, and organized identification, which is nationalism, must come to an end so that man may live peacefully with his fellowman. Through belief and through patriotism there can never be happiness for man.</p>
<p>Must you not go beyond and above the things made by the hand or by the mind to find truth? Right thinking, which comes with self-knowledge, alone can deliver you from the conflict and sorrow of existence.</p>
<p>Questioner: You have talked of exploitation as being evil. Do you not also exploit?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Critical capacity is necessary for self-knowledge, and credulity only leads to obstinacy and to illusion.</p>
<p>What do you mean by exploitation? Does it not mean the use of another for your own profit, either materially or psychologically? Material exploitation is minimized when the essential needs are intelligently understood and limited. To have much is a bothersome thing, as those who have much know. The limiting of needs can come about only when needs are not used for psychological gratification; when the essentials of existence - food, clothes, and shelter - are not made the means of self-aggrandizement. When things, made by the hand or by the mind, are given greater significance than their sensate value, then exploitation begins. When needs are used to gratify acquisitiveness, greed, then exploitation begins. Needs have their own limited significance - to feed one, to clothe one, to shelter one - but when needs become psychological necessities, then exploitation begins. A happy man does not depend for his happiness upon things, either made by the hand or by the mind; he has the treasure of the greatest significance. A man who has not that treasure makes sensate values predominant and thereby causes strife and misery.</p>
<p>The problem of psychological exploitation is more subtle and more profound. Psychologically we depend on things, on relationship, on ideas, or belief. Things, relationship, and ideas become all-important when they are used as a means of covering up the inward poverty, the inward emptiness. Being inwardly poor, insufficient, fearful, uncertain, we seek security, certainty, riches in those things made by the hand or by the mind. This search is the beginning of exploitation. We are aware of the results of seeking psychological security in things: war and degradation, class and national division, man against man, confusion and misery, the modern civilization the world over. Then you are the things and without them you are lost. In relationship, too, what happens if security is sought? Dependence breeds possessiveness, fear, jealousy, anger, and so on. The object of dependence becomes all-important, and so name, family, position become significant, with the result of conflicting division and misery. This dependence is the outcome of inward emptiness, which you try to cover up through gratifying relationship. When you are inwardly poor, things made by the mind - knowledge, idea, belief - become overwhelmingly important, which gives rise to imitation, to the worship of authority, to the acceptance of systems, to thoughtlessness.</p>
<p>The outward exploitation of man by man is comparatively easy to recognize and to understand and to minimize, but the psychological exploitation of man by man is far more difficult to recognize and to transcend. Its ways are subtle and hidden. It causes far greater conflict and misery than the outer exploitation of man by man. This psychological exploitation is far more important to understand and so put an end to than the material exploitation of man, which is also necessary. For however well-regulated or organized the material welfare of man is, the inner conflict and confusion always overcome the outer. This self-expansive process through things, through relationship, and through knowledge is the beginning of exploitation. Only understanding and love put an end to such exploitation and not legislation.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is the difference between surrendering to the will of God in suffering and what you are saying about the acceptance of what is?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Are you surrendering to the will of God? Or are you surrendering yourself to what you consider God? What you know is not the real. If you surrender to a higher will, then the higher is the projection of your own thought. There is gratification and comfort in such surrendering, but conflict and sorrow come to an end only through awareness and understanding. To understand what is there must be awareness, a passive intelligence and not the surrender to a formulation, however satisfying. To understand what is, effort is a hindrance, for effort, as I pointed out, exists only when there is distraction. To understand what is there must be no distraction, no effort. To understand what you are saying, I must not be distracted; I must give my whole attention. It is extremely arduous to be aware of what is, for our very thinking has become a distraction. We consider what is with prejudice, with a bias in its favor or against it, with condemnation or identification. What is is the actual, the real and to desire to change it is to run away from what is.</p>
<p>Only in understanding what is is there fundamental transformation. To understand what is, the conflict of the opposite must cease, for the opposite is the negative continuation of what is, the becoming which creates the opposite. The becoming is the denial of what is. To understand arrogance, the distraction of its opposite must cease, the effort of becoming, positively or negatively, must come to an end. If the feeling that is termed as arrogance is not named, then that feeling withers away. The response - pleasant or unpleasant - to a challenge withers away if it is not named, but as I pointed out love is utterly different. If love is the opposite of hate then it withers away.</p>
<p>This desire to accept what is is again a wrong approach. There is acceptance only when there is the desire to become; a fact does not demand acceptance; when there is a compulsion to evade what is, then there is an urge to accept it. To understand what is needs passive awareness. A mind that is caught in the net of time is translating what is in terms of the past and the future and so is incapable of understanding what is. A mind that is seeking escapes, distractions, however worthy and subtle, cannot understand what is. Without understanding what is, life is a constant conflict and pain; without being aware of the significance of what is, the real is not. Without the real there is no joy, no happiness.</p>
