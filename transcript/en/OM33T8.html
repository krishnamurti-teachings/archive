<p>I am going to try to put it differently, what I have been saying during the last four days, and previously also.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, without our giving deliberate thought to it, we are trying to seek certainty, certainty born from the knowledge which we gather from books, or our experiences, or the experiences of a wise man. So in seeking this certainty, we establish ideals, based on what others have said with conviction, seasoned in tradition. They become, as it were, the touchstone by which we choose, so that as a weight, as a measure, we can use that ideal or that certainty to judge what is false and what is true, what is essential and what is not essential. You will see that this is so, when you regard all the sacred literature of various countries and what people have made of it. You will see that they have created out of that what they desired truth to be, or God to be, or what they think a perfect spiritual life should be. And having created that certainty, then they use that as a measure by which to judge their conduct, their action, so that they can choose what is essential and what is not essential.</p>
<p>This establishment of certainty creates a constant necessity of choice and thereby increases effort. When once we have established a pattern, then constant choice exists, because according to that pattern we are acting. We decide our conduct according to that. So, whenever a choice, a decision has to be made, we decide according to that and thereby establish a series of continual choices. Naturally, this constant effort at choice increases, and this continued effort at choice, at decision, differentiating between the essential and the unessential, is called growth, progress, and evolution. This constant effort at choosing the essential, because you are seeking a certainty, must necessitate continued effort. And after accumulating through choice, we are afraid to lose what we have accumulated. That is why we are afraid of death. We make all effort to choose, and choice is based on certainty. And after accumulating, we are afraid of losing; and when there is death, we are afraid it will put an end to the plan which we have made for accumulating, so we are afraid of death.</p>
<p>Through choice we begin to accumulate, and when there is death, there is a fear of it, because there is a losing of that accumulation. Also, there is an end to planning, to further accumulation. Hence, there is a constant fear of death, and naturally, when there is a fear of death, we take comfort in the hereafter or in the idea of reincarnation. After accumulating, we are afraid of loss or of the emptiness which arises in the event of death, which prevents you from further accumulation. We want to be certain that we shall accumulate, that we shall continue that which we have accumulated, and hence we have taken consolation in the hereafter - heaven, hell - no comfort in hell, of course, but in the idea of reincarnation.</p>
<p>Our search is the certainty, not of truth - truth is not a certainty, to me certainty is false. We are seeking certainty, and that has become the goal and we call that certainty peace, tranquility, harmony, silence, light - all the spiritual words you have, higher plane, etc. So this certainty - please follow this - which you are seeking, prevents you from doubting. Because you are seeking a certainty, you are denying doubt, which has nothing to do with suspicion. If you look at yourself, you will see that you are all the time avoiding being in a condition of doubt, that is, a condition of pliability; you want to be certain, which to me necessitates a choice. In doubt there is no choice; doubt prevents choice.</p>
<p>So, when you crave for certainty, when you seek security, you must certainly discard and fear doubt. Now to me, doubt is a continual movement of thought and emotion, not blocked by certainty. When you are seeking certainty, you must have gurus, guides, saviors, and above all, a method of which you constantly ask, “What is the method to get at this truth?” When you say that, you mean, “What is the method by which I can be assured, certain.” Truth has nothing whatever to do with certainty, therefore there is no method to it, no technique, no way. When you are seeking certainty, also there must be discipline, spiritual and religious organization, all of which encourage and give you the support which you want, from which you can act.</p>
<p>To me then, certainty destroys this constant renewing of thought and emotion, this constant pliability, this constant subtlety. A mind that is certain cannot be subtle, swift. To follow wisdom, which is true value, you must be free from this false idea of certainty.</p>
<p>So choice or decision - hence, resistance in terms of certainty, which is an illusion - crystallizes and petrifies thought and feeling. That is what you call self-discipline. Please, I am using words here for you to look through. Words, for me, are like a glass to look through to the real significance of what I am saying.</p>
<p>So this is what is happening to the people who take certainty to their hearts, and to the people who are offering certainty. Where there is this overbalancing of certainty, there is not an even flow of thought and emotion. Where there is certainty, there cannot be understanding. Certainty is an illusion; it is false, inherently, like security. Where a mind is searching for security, it must have discipline, it must have an ideal by which it can guide itself. Then it must have those who will give you those ideals and then it must have many illusions in which it can take shelter, and thereby create this stagnation of the mind in which there is choice. Where the mind is certain, crystallized, there exist choice, opposites.</p>
<p>Now, if you have understood what I have said, that the illusion of this certainty which everyone is seeking with all its subtleties and deceptions, not only mentally, but if you understand it completely, you will feel the utter valuelessness of certainty. Then your being is not split up, the mind is not trying to control the emotion which wants to be certain. Then your mind does not impose discipline on the emotion which wants to be assured. But if you want certainty emotionally, then your mind will inflict a discipline, then there is conflict, then there is continual effort. Whereas, if you really understand it with all your being, with your mind as well as your heart, wholly - the futility of certainty which creates time, the fear of death, a beginning and an end - then your action itself is freed from certainty without effort.</p>
<p>Effort exists when your mind and heart are not in full harmonious agreement, when your mind wants certainty and your emotions do not want certainty. To make them come together in perfect union, each must be fully aware of the other, is that not so? What is happening is that you want certainty emotionally, which you keep hidden, and mentally you do not want certainty, which is exposed. So they never meet. Whereas, if you are frank and let them meet, you will know then that flame of awareness which destroys false illusions.</p>
<p>You may have understood more or less intellectually, naturally not with all its significance, because you have not had time to think about it. You have understood sufficiently intellectually, but emotionally you may still want certain things, and hence the conflict of not wanting and wanting. Do not try to dominate one over the other, or do not try to identify one with the other, but let your mind become conscious of your emotional desire for certainty and let your emotion become aware of the mental understanding of the futility of certainty. It is very simple, if you follow it. The difficulty is, you are so full of knowledge, you are so full of certainty, which destroys you. There is not the pliability, the eagerness to find out. When you are eager to find out, there cannot be certainty; there must be a freedom, there must be a movement, there must be swiftness. But a mind that is anchored to a certainty of knowledge cannot wander, cannot follow, cannot pursue that wisdom.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Why do you say, “Beware of the man who says,</span> ‘I <i>know’.” Cannot he be truthful who says,</i> ‘I <i>know’?</i></p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He can be truthful, but such a man does not know what truth is. Why do you pay respect to a man who says, “I know that there is God, that there is truth, that there is immortality, that there is a Master”? Why do you pay respect? Because you are seeking certainty.</p>
<p>You can only know that which is static, not that which is dynamic, moving. You cannot say, “I know a thing that is moving.” It is truth, that which is alive. You cannot describe it, you cannot put it in a frame and say, “This is it.” Because we are seeking this constant certainty, assurance, security, we give all our love, our devotion, our trust, everything to the man who says, “I know.” You yourself want to be quiet, you yourself desire this constant assurance, which you think will free you from this conflict. It does not, it only dulls you.</p>
<p>Truth is not to be known; it is not static, it is not an end, a goal. It is a continual renewing, ever-becoming. Therefore, beware of the man who says, “I know” - not of the man, but of yourself - because you respect that man who gives you what you want, comfort. Therein lies exploitation; you are creating that man as your exploiter.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You speak earnestly about understanding, but you depreciate tolerance. Is not a man of true understanding really tolerant?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Understanding has nothing to do with tolerance. You do not love anybody greatly when you tolerate them, do you? Tolerance is an intellectual thing. You say, “Truth has so many sides, so many paths.” All paths lead to truth, whatever the method you have, the mode. So, having created a theory, you then proceed to be tolerant to that theory, to the people who follow it; whereas, understanding is complete. In that, there is no tolerance, which is such a false thing from my point of view. Either a man is in illusion or he is not in illusion. But because we cannot be friendly, we invent the word <i>tolerance</i>. Because you happen to disagree with me, in what I am saying - and I think the majority of you do - don’t shake your heads; you do, or otherwise your actions would be different.</p>
<p>I am not tolerant to you. If I were your superior, if I were intellectually saying, “You will also arrive at that truth from your particular illusion,” then I would be tolerant. But I say that you cannot know what truth is by any illusion, by the illusion of ceremonies, Masters, discipline, any of these. So there is no tolerance. Not that I am not friendly, not that I want you to come over to my way of understanding. You know, when there is real affection you are not tolerant. You are not tolerant in your love, you are tolerant to the man who thinks differently from you. Because there is no understanding, you have invented intellectually this word <i>tolerance</i> or you use a bigger word, <i>brotherhood.</i></p>
<p>Don’t you see, there are only two things, truth and illusion. And the man who understands truth is not tolerant to an illusion; it is an illusion. He understands it, and he understands it only when he discovers the right value of those illusions. If he does not, then you will have to be tolerant with regard to those illusions. To put it differently, each one of you wants to pursue his own particular narrow little way - either nationalistic, capitalistic, class distinctions, or religious or temperamental distinctions. You want to pursue individualistically your own narrow way, and you have to invent the words <i>tolerance</i> and <i>brotherhood</i> to keep you within decent bounds. Whereas, if you are free of all these limitations, if you are really fighting against that, destroying that, then you would not be tolerant, you would be really friendly because there would be understanding.</p>
<p>Now, you want to cling to your own national flag, and you feel so elated when you do it that when another does the same thing you have to be tolerant to him. If you have not a flag, if you are perfectly empty, naked, then you would understand true wisdom, which cannot be arrived at through this narrow idea of brotherhood or tolerance.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>I do not understand the sentence, “Love not with the mind.” Will you explain?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Tolerance is loving with the mind, brotherhood is loving with the mind. Because our minds are so acutely developed in cunningness, in subtlety, in selfishness, we are forcing ourselves to be tolerant, or love one another, or help another, serve another - all intellectual things. Whereas, if you really love with your mind as well as with your heart, with your whole being, you are not tolerant, you are not helpful, you are not searching out service. You <i>are,</i> and therefore you love, therefore you serve, therefore you help.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You have said that one or two people like yourself would change the face of the world. Would it not be a kindness to us, if you married and brought up a few children whom you could assist from the very commencement to be free of reactions. At present all my virtues and vices are actually aroused and there seems little hope of getting out of them as an adult. If I could become your child next life, could not you bring me up as a free, liberated man?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think the answer to this question has been given by your laughing about it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You say that ceremonies are bom out of unrighteousness. Is that not a point of view, say, of yours and of those of a particular temperament, or do you say this as a truth, universal in its application?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Did you notice yesterday and the day before, when I talked about sex and ceremonies, what attention there was? I wonder how many of you noticed it. Why was there this attention? Because you were interested. That attention does not exist when I am taking about something real. Not that ceremonies and sex are not real to you. Isn’t it extraordinary!</p>
<p>I am not putting them together, but it happens - life is like that. My point is, you are concerned about sex and about ceremonies and yet you are seeking - at least, you are attempting to seek - truth or God or any of these things. And your natural instincts are these, because by your attention you showed it. I am talking now about what you are really interested in. That struck me so much yesterday and the day before. You want a way out of sex, a way out of ceremonies, whether you should do it or not do it. A complete man, a man who is really rich in himself, self-sufficient, to him this confusion does not exist; there is no choice to be made.</p>
<p>You ask now if, where there are ceremonies, there is unrighteousness - is that my particular point of view, representing a particular temperament, or is it universal as a truism? A man who has a temperament cannot understand truth; a man who is particular cannot understand the whole. I say that I have understood the whole. I say ceremony is an illusion - not as a particular, Krishnamurti, human being, but as a true thing. It has no validity. You may give all kinds of attributes to ceremony in your search for sensation, security. It is longing to grow, which is to accumulate, and therefore not death. I know some of you are ceremonialists; you want to do them, and there is nothing more to be said. I am not tolerant with you. I do not feel the distinction. If you feel like it, go ahead and do it. But since you are here and want to understand what I am saying with regard to ceremony, you must have an open mind. You cannot say that is my particular temperament and therefore I feel like that. You say, “Because I have been surrounded by so many ceremonialists, my reaction is to be against ceremonies,” or, “Because I am so advanced, ceremonies are futile for me, but you say you need them,” or, “We do it because of its intrinsic beauty, like a pianist.” A pianist does not talk like that. The people who are insincere, who are not frank, talk like that. I am not harsh - I really do not care, honestly, whether you perform ceremonies. I mean it. Not that I am tolerant, because I understand - at least I think I do - why you perform ceremonies, why ceremonies are so important to you, as your search for the Master and discipleship and all the rest of it, why it is important. I understand it, because it gives you a certain sensation, this idea that you are being looked after, have a personal God, security, certainty, comfort.</p>
<p>So when you see a thing so blatantly, openly, you cannot be tolerant about it. You understand it. So I am not talking out of harshness or hardness of heart, or out of impatience or of a particular temperament, or that I want you to follow what I am saying. I really do not care, because I am not seeking a result. I do not want you to come over to my particular point of view, because I have no point of view at all. I have not a fixed thing which says: This is truth, this is false. I say, in the very illusion - if you understand it with all its significance - lies the flowering of truth, in the very illusion itself. As you are surrounded by illusions, do not cling to them, examine them, go into them profoundly. Do not say, “I like it, therefore I accept it.” Because you are so prejudiced, you want to cling to it. I cannot think of all the excuses you give when you are performing a ceremony. So do not say, “He did not say that, so therefore I can go on.”</p>
<p>To me, the whole idea inherently has no true value because it is born of fear, this search for solution, sensation. And I say, if you really understand it, if you approach it not only intellectually but with your whole being, you ripen your thought with regard to ceremony and ripen your emotion with regard to ceremony; completely let them come together and let them find out without your identifying yourself with one or the other. Let it flow as you let a kite fly in the sky. Let your thoughts and emotions loose and you will find out. If you feel you should do it, do it, don’t discuss about it. It is like people that come to me and ask “Should I leave a particular society or should I have an attitude to a particular society?” If they want it, they remain. Don’t you see, life becomes beautifully simple when you treat it simply. It is only when you are trying to get something out of it that you have complications.</p>
<p>You can be like the savage who is satisfied with what he has, or a truly consummate man who is free from all sense of want.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>How do you look today on your little book</span> At the Feet of the Master?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wonder why you ask me that. Either you want me to censor my book of the past or ask you not to read it. In other words, you want me to act as a censor of what you shall read and what you shall not read. This question implies whether I still believe in Masters, or whether you, who are giving my ideas abroad, should introduce this book, because now I no longer believe in Masters. So you are acting as the censor of what other people should read, and you are asking me to do exactly the same thing with what you should read. Read it, if you are interested in reading it. Don’t say, “I should read this book and not this book.”</p>
<p>Much more is implied in this question. You are trying to create a sect around me. You have that sectarian mind which is seeking a result, and you ask yourself, “Shall I distribute this or not?” If a man wants it, give it to him; let him find out, for heaven’s sake, whether the Master exists, whether you must go through discipleship or all the rest. If you don’t give it to him, someone else will. So, why not give it to him?</p>
<p>Now, to go further back to this question, this idea of a guru leading you to truth, a Master, a guide, a leader. You notice, we go through this every year. This whole idea of discipleship, this whole idea of pursuing a Master who will lead you to truth, is utterly false. Please, I am not talking from a certain temperament: not because I have realized, therefore I looked down on him. Do not think of all these things, but come to it freshly, get your minds fresh, not burdened with all these ideas.</p>
<p>Now, what does discipleship and Mastership mean fundamentally, apart from names and people who tell you they exist. We are not discussing that, whether they exist or not - that is a very small thing - but the idea behind it. Why do you want them at all? Why do you seek them at all? Because you want to be sure that you will come to that truth, and so you create exploiters, people who will tell you whether you are disciples or not, priests, and all the men who possess you, all the tribe of capitalists or communists or anything.</p>
<p>You want to be assured that you are progressing, that you are growing, that your efforts have an end and will bring about a result. So when you are seeking that, then people arise naturally who tell you, “There are results, you can be assured, you can be made certain.” And so you feel quite happy in your action because you are going to get something at the end of it. That is, if you behave righteously, if you do certain things, you will get something in return, which is the old primitive idea that you butcher the animal to please a God. Only, we do it now intellectually, more subtly; we butcher our own individual thinking, freedom, that ecstasy of living, for a reward which we seek.</p>
<p>You cannot realize truth in any action; you cannot know that immortal ecstasy through the search for a reward, nor can you find the thing, realize it, or understand it through another. It is only when the mind is absolutely pliable - free from all choices - when action is complete, that you will know what that living ecstasy, that infinite reality is; that ever renewing, becoming life.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You have said that, though one should be free from authority in spiritual life, it was necessary in material work. Is not there a danger that in this statement the authority of those who are in authority and are still “conditioned by fear” is excused, even where this hampers and throttles the developing mentality of spontaneous and pure action in those who work under this authority? What is your opinion on this point?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I will put differently the same thing which I put two years ago. Where there is authority, there cannot be understanding. If you are freeing yourself from authority because you understand it, not because you throw it overboard and say, “I must not obey something” - then you will obey something, then you will obey somebody, because the government will come down and hold you. But if you are freeing yourself, because you understand authority, then authority does not exist for you even in material things.</p>
<p>You do not cooperate because of authority - I know we do because of fear - but if you understand the significance, the meaning, the thing that lies behind authority, and you yourself, because of that understanding, are free of it, then you will cooperate with authority. That is, because you are rich in yourself, nothing can mold you, because you are infinitely pliable, you are not afraid of going into that thing which is holding you, because then nothing will hold you. It is because we are not free from the exertion of authority or of looking through authority, because we are not rich in ourselves, that we are afraid that external authority will pervert our thought subtly, and feeling.</p>
<p>So, when you understand the authority of certainty, when you are really free from this desire to be certain, assured, secure, when your whole being is full as the moon - without any thing to lose - then there is no authority, nor its opposite, humility.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>By continually looking and searching in oneself does not one become egotistic?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Certainly, you do become egotistic. That is what has happened. Why ask such a question? I have never been advocating that. On the contrary, all these processes of psychoanalysis, dissecting oneself, watching oneself in action, introspection, must necessarily bring about a narrowing down of mind and heart, which we call egotistic. I have been talking of exactly the opposite. I have said that in self-analysis there is destruction and I have explained the reason why. You analyze only when you have not understood, and to understand is not to analyze, to look back, but to meet everything afresh, anew - not to reopen a dead thing and examine that dead thing. From that you will not understand. But if you are fully awakened, alive, alert, and you meet an alive thing, then you will understand that. And in that awakened interest all the hindrances of the past come into being, without your delving into the subconscious to bring it out. You cannot understand a dead thing, you can only understand a live thing.</p>
<p>So naturally, the more and more you think about your actions - the more and more you watch, introspect, and analyze - the narrower, the more irksome, tiresome, struggling becomes your life. That is what has happened. This is self-discipline, this search for certainty, assurance - all this has led to a deep, subtle egotism. And to me this duality in action, the watcher and the thing that is acting, destroys harmonious action. And it is only in harmonious action, which takes place only when there is a crisis, that you discover the true value of things. It is only when you act harmoniously that you discover the right value of things, and that gives you the richness of understanding, and hence all the conflicts of introspection and self-analysis disappear.</p>
