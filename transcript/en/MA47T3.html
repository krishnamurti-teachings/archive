<p>The reformation of society can come only through the regeneration of the individual. There is hope in the individual, in you, not in a system, not in the blueprint of a planned society, not in any religious organization, but in you, the individual. Your relationship with another is society, which brings into being the state. The state is not a separate and uncontrollable entity; it is the outcome of individual thought and action. Though we constantly assert, verbally, that we must love each other, that life is one, that we must strive for brotherhood, actually this relationship between man and man is based on sensate value. This relationship of sensory values has produced wars, ruthlessness, conflict, chaos. This relationship has given birth to individual enterprise and to its opposite, collective action; both individual enterprise and collective action are based on sensory values.</p>
<p>Man, the individual, you, has not found lasting happiness either through the activities of the right or of the left; man is in despair, confused and in sorrow. Does man's happiness lie in sensate values? That is, does your happiness lie in things made by the hand or by the mind? Through self-knowledge alone, the truth of this question can be discovered. A truth is not a truth when repeated; it must be felt, experienced. Self-knowledge is self-discovery. Through self-knowledge alone can you discover truth and lasting happiness. Self-knowledge is the choiceless awareness of the actual process of your whole being. This self-knowledge cannot be learned through a book nor through another. To be aware of the total entity that you are, to be aware of the conscious and unconscious process of your thoughts, feelings, and activities is self-knowledge. The beginning of self-knowledge is to be aware of your mental and emotional activities.</p>
<p>Without self-knowledge there is no basis for thought and action. Self-knowledge is the foundation for all thought and action. If you do not know yourself, there cannot be right thinking and right action. There can be no revolution in values if there is no self-knowledge; this revolution in values alone will solve the world's problems. Since you are the world, since your relationship with another is society, without a revolutionary change of values, which you bring about through self-knowledge, there can be no peace and order, no hope from this confusion and mounting sorrow. So to understand yourself is of the highest importance. To talk of transforming society is utterly vain without self-knowledge. We assert that the problems of the world must be solved as though the world were different from us. Each one of us has contributed towards this conflict, this confusion, this antagonism, this mounting insanity, and we cannot put an end to it if we do not know how to think of the problem, how to approach it, how to examine it. The approach is of greater importance than the problem itself. The problem is not the world but you; you cannot rightly think of the problem until you are aware of it as your most pressing and immediate problem. You may not be aware of it as though it were outside of you. You have created the problem, so you have to be aware of yourself as the problem. The confusion in you has to be cleared away, for to act in confusion is to breed more confusion.</p>
<p>The transformation, the regeneration must begin with you and not with another; this is the right approach. Be aware of your mental and emotional activities, of your daily habits and ideas, of your repetitive fears, of class and communal divisions, of national and racial antagonisms. Before there can be peace in the world, there must be peace and order in you.</p>
<p>We are confronted with one of the most extraordinary catastrophes and with a confusion that is very profound; we are meeting it with systems, with ready-made formulations, with conclusions of this or that group. To bring peace and order out of this chaos, there must be revolution in values; the confusion has arisen because we are dominated by sensate values; we have to rediscover eternal values. The discovery of eternal values must be made by each one; the reformation must begin with each one. Be aware of every thought and feeling and so of every action, for truth is near and not far away.</p>
<p>Questioner: In a recent article by a famous correspondent, it was stated that wisdom and personal example are not enough to solve the problems of the world. What do you think?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: As there are many implications in this question, we must analyze them. By correspondents, who have axes to grind, we are persuaded not how to think but what to think; generally, we unfortunately accept what we read. The so-called education has stopped us from thinking, from being aware; writers and correspondents become very important in our lives. We have to be aware of this tendency to accept what is printed. This correspondent and many others demand a political action and personal example. Personal example and political action are not enough to solve the world's problems. Something much more fundamental is needed.</p>
<p>Imitation and conformity are inherent in personal example. The conformity to an ideal can never diminish the burden of sorrow. Personal example in a great crisis is of little significance. Wisdom does not come through imitation, through regimentation of thought; wisdom has no fixed abode; wisdom does not lie in much reading. Political action must ever be partial, incomplete action and so untrue, causing further confusion and misery. What is necessary is a revolution in thinking and feeling. This creative revolution cannot be brought about by a few leaders, by a political action or through a personal example. It is only possible through individual awakening. Personal example or political action according to any formula will not save the world from the catastrophe. Man puts faith in a system, in a party, in leaders, and they have invariably failed. In you alone is there hope, not in another.</p>
<p>It is a human crisis, not an economic or political catastrophe; man's entire being is involved and not any one of his activities. The problem is not the world but you are the problem. Because you are thinking in terms of conclusions and formulations, of systems and patterns, you have brought to yourself, and so to the world, this confusion and misery. Personal examples will not deliver you from conflict and pain. Revolution in values, which creative thinking brings, is very arduous, and so we look to others, to leaders, to examples. The thinking that we do is a response to a conditioning, and so it is not thinking at all. Because you are a Hindu, you are conditioned to a certain pattern of thought and behavior - as the Muslim, as the Christian, and so on. Surely this is not thinking. There can be creative revolution in thinking and feeling only when there is freedom from conditioning, not only from the conscious, but also from the hidden conditioning. You have ceased to be of any nationality, of any system, religious or political; you have to transcend the fallacies of social and economic divisions to think creatively. You agree with what I am saying and probably will come here Sunday after Sunday, but you will unfortunately continue in the set pattern of thought and behavior. So your assent is very superficial and so has no significance. If you begin to question the pattern and to act, you will undoubtedly create more trouble and pain for yourself; so, being aware of this, you give your assent superficially, verbally stating that the world is in a confusion and something must be done about it.</p>
<p>So the problem is you; for you are the world, the mass, the state. If you are aware of the conflict and sorrow within you, the confusion and the ache, in transcending them you are solving the world's problems. Organizational and political problems are comparatively easy to solve; mere theories and book knowledge are not going to deliver you, and so the world, from confusion and misery. Book knowledge becomes a hindrance to direct understanding and action. You must break through your conditioning and those degenerative values which you yourself have created about you. There is no hope in systems, in political actions, impersonal examples, in the leaders, but there is hope only in yourself.</p>
<p>Questioner: What do you mean when you say that we use the present as a passage to the past or to the future?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Last Sunday I said that in using the present as a passage to the past or the future, you are breeding disaster and misery. We use the present as a means to an end, psychologically or physiologically; the present is used only as a passage to the past or to the future. The present is the result of the past; what you now think is based on the past; your being is founded on the past. The past is ever weaving through the present to the future; the future is the past conditioned through the present. The past can only be understood through the present; the door to the past lies through the present. To understand the significance of the past, the present must be comprehended and not be sacrificed for the future. The political and religious groups that sacrifice the present for the future utopia and hope bring disaster and misery to man. The disastrous implications in sacrificing the present for the future are fairly clear. The means are the end; the end is in the means; the means and the end cannot be separated.</p>
<p>The eternal is the present; the timeless is the now. It cannot be approached through time. Yet you are using time - the past, the present, and the future - as a means to realize the immeasurable, the timeless. One has to be aware of the fallacy of sacrificing the present for the future and of the fallacy that the future is going to be different from the present. If you have no understanding now, you will not have understanding in the future: wisdom is ever in the present and does not abide in the future.</p>
<p>Thought is the result of the past, and to understand and so free thought from the past, be aware of what you are now, your thoughts, feelings, and actions; then you will perceive that you are using the present as a mere passage. The time process will not lead to the timeless for the means is the end. If you are using wrong means, you will create wrong ends; only right means will create the right end. War is a wrong means to peace. The means is the end and the end is not disassociated from the means. If there is to be understanding of the timeless, that which is bound to time, thought, must free itself from the past which through the present becomes the future.</p>
<p>Questioner: The communists say that the rulers of Indian States, the zamindars, and the capitalists are the chief exploiters of the nation and that they should be liquidated in order to secure food, clothing, and shelter for all. Gandhi says that the rulers, the zamindars, and the capitalists are the trustees of the persons under their control and influence, and therefore they may be allowed to remain and function. What do you say?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: It is very odd that everywhere in the world people are acquainted with what their leaders and groups, either of the left or of the right, think, but they themselves do not seem to know what they think. They attach great significance to what others, so-called prominent people, say and very little significance to their own thoughts. What is important is what you think and feel, for it is your life, your misery and conflict that is concerned. Let us regard this question as though we had never read a book nor read any speeches of your so-called leaders. The question is concerned with exploitation and how to be rid of it. How do you become a zamindar or a maharajah? Surely by exploiting the people. To pursue more than what you need becomes exploitation. You need food, clothes, and shelter, but when they become the means of personal aggrandizement, then exploitation begins. To use another to gain power and position, authority and domination, is exploitation. Exploitation is the problem and not who exploits. The capitalist, the ruler, the zamindar are like you; if you had the chance you would become like them. You would lose your generosity, your love, the moment you climb the ladder of success, of gain.</p>
<p>Are the capitalists, the zamindars, the Indian State rulers, trustees? To trust there must be love, but love ceases with greed, with the desire to dominate, to influence. Love ceases when you give importance to yourself as a leader or as a zamindar. Both the leader and the led exploit, as well as the maharajah and the capitalist. Do not be persuaded by any what to think, but be thoughtful.</p>
<p>The problem is exploitation. Does the exploitation cease through collective action, and is it increased through individual enterprise? We know that individual greed and the craving for power has plunged the world into confusion and sorrow; we also see that an all-powerful state can and does exploit and bring about other forms of conflict and misery. We see that greed and the craving for power in the individual and in the state or in the collective are destructive, ruthless. In organizing collectively man's necessities, the exploitation of man's being and what he thinks and feels is also being carried on. With acquisition there must ever be exploitation; the craving for acquisition must inevitably bring about exploitation. Acquisition is always psychological. When emphasis is laid on you as an acquiring entity, the individual or the collective, there will be always exploitation. This does not mean that we should not organize for the physical welfare of man, but if the organizer uses the organization as a means of acquisition, then he and the organization will become the means of exploitation.</p>
<p>Can man live in relationship with another without acquisition, which is without exploitation? Can you live in a society without acquisitiveness? Can you live without more and more, without more and more property, which represents power, position, and psychological security? Because you are unwilling not to acquire and not to use human needs as a means to self-aggrandizement, both the movements of the right and the left are liquidating you in their own way. But liquidation, murder, is not, surely, the way.</p>
<p>So can acquisitiveness be relinquished voluntarily? Can you let go freely the craving for power - power gained through the things made by the hand or by the mind? If you do not, society, the others, in their acquisitiveness, are going to compel you, and then you will become a mere cog, as you are now, in another vast social machine. This voluntary abandonment of acquisitiveness is the way out of this suffocating confusion. Acquisitiveness comes with the desire to be secure; the more there is confusion, the greater the desire to be secure. But is there security? Because we have sought security, psychological security, we have created confusion and misery about us. Unless you voluntarily relinquish acquisitiveness, the state will control and regiment you; you will be exploited then by the collective instead of by individuals or by groups. If you voluntarily and intelligently put aside this craving to possess, then you will create a society not based on compulsion and exploitation.</p>
<p>To create a new society you must radically transform your present values, which demands pliable alertness and an extending awareness; but being apathetic, indifferent, you will be directed and compelled, and the world's problems, which are your own, are not dissolved through compulsion. It is arduous to understand the deeper, psychological significance of exploitation, and without understanding it, to merely substitute one exploiter for another is to continue in strife and misery. Because psychologically, inwardly, you are poor, aching with loneliness, with emptiness, possessions made by the hand or by the mind assume predominating significance. This constant companion, this aching void, must be faced and understood; then exploitation, which is psychological, will cease.</p>
<p>Questioner: Are your teachings intended only for the sannyasis or for all of us with families and responsibilities?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: These teachings are meant for all, for those who have renounced the world and for those who are in it. The renouncer is still in the world of his burning desires, as the man of the world. They are both held in bondage - the bondage of sensate values or the bondage of the mind. These teachings bring freedom to both. Reality is not found either in things made by the hand or by the mind; truth is the liberator, the truth of what is. One has to understand what is - the passions and the envies, the ill will and the acquisitiveness - and the understanding of what is is its own liberation. One realizes at rare moments, when the mind is riot occupied with itself, when the self is absent, that truth which liberates.</p>
<p>The man of family is caught in the world of his own responsibilities. The more there is confusion about him, the more he is concerned with his family, with himself, and so seeks security, which only adds further confusion. Instead of understanding the significance of confusion himself, he looks to the security of his family, which he calls responsibility. He must bring peace and order within himself and not escape from this fact through the apprehensive search for security. The man who has renounced the world - he too is caught in the desire for security; he is not different for he is burdened with the formulations of his own mind; they too bring him confusion and sorrow. Creation, reality, is when the mind ceases to create.</p>
<p>Is it possible to live in the world without greed and ill will, without stupidity and those passions that destroy man? Yes, it is possible. You may laugh but it is possible. Try and see if it is not possible. To live without greed and ill will, you must be very alert, aware of every thought and feeling; following a leader, accepting conclusions and formulas indicate the lack of awareness which alone can free you from conflict and misery. Without love, family has no significance, and love alone can bring about regeneration and a happy world.</p>
<p>Questioner: You may have heard of the awful tragedy that has taken place and is even now taking place in the Punjab. Will the individual action based on self-knowledge and right thinking by the few who are capable of such action be significant to the solution of this Punjab problem?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: What is happening in the Punjab is happening the world over; it is not peculiarly an Indian problem - man's inhumanity to man. Who is responsible for this tragedy? Each one of us; each one is bound to some religious or racial or national stupidity. Do you not think in terms of Hindus and Muslims, of the Germans and the English? We are not human beings; we are mere labels; as nationalistic and patriotic spirit is on the increase everywhere in the world, there is bound to be conflict, confusion, and antagonism. A disease has a cause, and until the cause is removed there cannot be good health. For generations we have lived on wrong thinking and naturally it must result in conflict and misery. This chaos and misery is the outcome of the cultivation of sensate values; through awareness of the cause, the cause ceases to be. The dissolution of the cause is not a matter of time, not of growth, but of immediate perception. We do not immediately perceive for various reasons, one of them being the fear and the consequence of immediate action. So though we are capable of immediate perception, we carry on in our old stupid ways as it is more convenient, not demanding exertion. You must awaken to the causes of misery and disaster, not tomorrow but now. Do not build your philosophy on time, but be aware of what is, which will lead thought to the infinite.</p>
<p>Questioner: You say discipline is opposed to freedom. But is not discipline necessary for freedom?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: A wrong means can only produce a wrong end, a right means brings about the right end. The means and the end are not separate; they are interrelated, they are one.</p>
<p>If thought is disciplined, regimented, held in a groove of habit, it can only perceive or understand that which is conditioned, limited. If you discipline your mind according to a pattern, then you are bound to produce an end carved out of the means. You discipline yourself either out of fear or out of greed, and the end will be fashioned out of your motives. But where there is greed and fear, reality is not.</p>
<p>But you will say, ''I must organize my daily life, otherwise I can do nothing, and is not this organization a kind of discipline?'' You organize your daily activities in order to be efficient, to do the many things that have to be done; in order to achieve a result, you discipline or organize yourself. Even such an organized existence becomes a hindrance to pliability, for that which is pliable is enduring. Now, is truth a result? If it is a result it can be achieved through a means, and a result has a cause. But that which has a cause is no longer reality. Truth gives freedom, not discipline, and through discipline truth is not.</p>
<p>To put the problem differently: need you become a drunkard in order to know sobriety? There must be an understanding of the causes which necessitate discipline and their full implication. The desire to gain, to succeed, to be directed, and fear are some of the causes that bring about imitation, the practice of a discipline; in being aware of the causes, the effect - discipline, conformity - cease to be. Then the problem is shifted to the dissolution of the cause, which is not a maker of time.</p>
<p>With awareness there comes freedom, not only of the causes of discipline, but of the whole process of living. Freedom can only come when the mind frees itself from its own self-created conditioning, when it is not conditioned to any pattern of thought. When do you discover or understand? Only when there is freedom, when your thought and feeling is not bound or trained to any pattern of desire. A mind that is in bondage is vagrant, restless, disorderly. When the mind is aware of the causes of its own wandering, then there is already freedom.</p>
<p>Thought cannot understand or formulate what is truth; truth must come to you, you cannot go to it. To receive, there must be freedom. There must be choiceless awareness - not condemnatory and identifying awareness - which brings freedom. In freedom alone can there be the real, the immeasurable.</p>
