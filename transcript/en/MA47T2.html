<p>Life is a complex problem, and to understand it there must be patient analysis of the problem and not jumping to a comforting conclusion; there must be a sane detachment to understand the actual, the existing problem. So let us take the journey of understanding. In making this journey do not let us jump to any conclusion and action; we shall act, not based upon any conclusion but upon truth. If we are attached, committed to any form of action, we shall not be capable of understanding the complex process of living; if we are too close to the problem, we are incapable of right observation and comprehension. If we are to understand life, there must be no conclusion, for conclusion puts an end to right thinking. As living is a vast process, any conclusion would be petty and biased. So let us discuss together, if we can, seriously and earnestly, the problem of living and not merely listen superficially to a series of talks; though I may talk, it is your life that is concerned, your joys and pains, your sorrows and strifes.</p>
<p>As every phase of life is interrelated, we must not approach it through any exclusive, specialized path; the merely intellectual or merely the emotional, the psychological or the merely physiological, prevents the understanding of the total process, which is life. In emphasizing the one path, the one phase, we only create conclusions which prevent the understanding of the whole. If we only study or specialize in one corner of the picture, we shall not comprehend the significance of the whole. If you specialize in economics and try to comprehend life from that limited point of view, you will inevitably miss the deeper and wider significance of life and so bring about greater confusion. For the time being, put aside your specializations and look at life as a whole. The more we specialize, the more limited, destructive, we shall become. Our human problems are not to be solved by specialists, by experts. The few that can comprehend the entire picture, the whole process of life - they will be the saviors and not the specialists, not the experts.</p>
<p>Life, living and action, is a very complex problem which, if you would understand, must be approached very simply. If you would understand a child, a complex entity, you must not impose upon it your conditioning; you must observe without condemnation. If you see a lovely sunset and you compare it with other sunsets you have seen, then the present sunset has no joy. To understand, there must be a mind that is simple, not an innocent mind, but that which perceives directly and does not translate it according to its conditioning. This is one of our major difficulties in the right approach to the comprehension of life.</p>
<p>What is your relationship to the present degradation and chaos, to the prevailing despair? Perhaps you are not deeply aware of this degradation and despair. Everywhere, here and Europe, we see the utter failure of religion and education, the collapse of systems, either of the left or of the right. What is your relationship to this frightful confusion, to this destructive chaos? If you would bring order out of this chaos, where would you begin? Obviously with yourself, for your relationship with this crisis, with this degradation is direct. Let us not put the blame of this disaster on the few unbalanced leaders or on the systems, for you have created this confusion, and to bring order and peace out of it, you must begin with yourself; you must put order in your own house. Do not let us consider the rightness or wrongness of systems and formulas which promise hope; do not let us consider theories nor outer revolutions; we must begin with ourselves, for we, you and I, are responsible for this disaster, for this confusion. Without you there is no world; you are the world, you are the problem. This assertion is not an intellectual formulation but an actual fact. Do not set it aside, which only indicates your desire to escape from it.</p>
<p>When you recognize your obvious responsibility for the strife and sorrow, what you think, feel, and do, what you are becomes vitally significant, and because you are unwilling to face it, you look to systems, to formulas, to comforting escapes. It is a fact that you are the world, and you are responsible for this aching confusion, and our talks must be based on this fact. Because you are the problem and there is no independent problem apart from you, you have to understand yourself if you would bring peace and order. When you are aware of this fact, you have to act positively and vigorously, and because you are afraid of such an action, you look to systems and to leaders. The only essential and starting point is you.</p>
<p>Your individual responsibility is denied, smothered, by giving importance to systems, whether the left or the right or whether it be religious. Systems or formulas to save man become more important than man himself, than you. Organized society takes away individual responsibility; it makes him conform. And society, the state, becomes more important than the individual; through bureaucracy, the boredom of office and routine, the individual creative responsibility is slowly destroyed. The organized religion of dogma and belief saps away individual responsibility and freedom; through belief and dogma, the individual, you, feel secure, so you bring into being organized religion, the state, the system. Man, you, becomes unimportant through the efficiency of the machine, political or mechanical; the industry, the party assume great significance, and you become merely a tool to be made efficient, to be a unit of a doctrine. This is happening to you, you are responsible for this death and irresponsibility, and yet you are not realizing this fact.</p>
<p>Education, instead of awakening you to creative responsibility, is turning you out to be specialists along different lines: lawyers, police, army, and so on. You are educated and you cease to be an individual with deep significance. The more you are educated, the more you are conditioned; the more you read, the more you repeat, and so the less you are capable of revolutionary thinking. Regimentation, through the activities of society and state, education, army, and so on, is imposed upon you. So these and other factors make you a repetitive machine, unaware of your responsibility and significance.</p>
<p>To bring order and peace out of this darkness and misery, you have to start with yourself and not with the system, for psychologically you are always the master of the machine, of the system. You are of the greatest significance and not the society nor the state, for your relationship with another is society; what you think, what you feel, what you do is of the utmost importance, for you create the environment, the state. Before answering questions, I wish to say that questions will have the right answers if the questioner is earnest in his intentions. If you merely ask an intellectual, superficial question, you may trap me but you will be the loser.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is the kind of thing that is needed today to live in peace? At the same time, could you show a way by which millions of people can be fed?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: To have peace you must live peacefully. There are many causes which bring about strife between man and man. Property is one of the causes of contention. Possession of things made by the hand or by the mind leads to strife; the use of things as an instrument for personal gain causes enmity between man and man. So if you want peace you must live without greed; envy is one of the factors that makes for nationalism, setting man against man. Competition and the desire for success, ambition, cause conflict between man and man. Organized religion divides man from man; one dogma, one belief invariably breeds opposing dogma and belief; belief and dogma antagonize man with his fellow man. Conversion is not the way of peace. To have peace you must be free from the causes of antagonism, you must be peaceful. Communalism and the adherence to a particular system, whether economic or religious, does not lead to peace. To have peace you must cease to be a Muslim or a Hindu, a Christian or a Buddhist, for all racial and religious divisions are false, breeding conflict, confusion, and antagonism.</p>
<p>When there is peace in your heart, then it is comparatively easy to organize food, clothing, shelter for all. If you are not free from ambition, from the craving for position and power, then the organization of man's necessities is made impossible; then systems become all-important and not man. There is enough knowledge to feed, clothe, and shelter man, but the men of knowledge are petty and nationalistic, like you, ambitious and greedy. Separatism is a poison that is corrupting the world, you, and if you were aware of this, you would not hesitate to put an end to it. But you are not aware of it; you are vaguely concerned about the starving millions; it is not an immediate and insistent problem. The crisis is far away for most of us, at least you think it is far away, and so you are concerned verbally over it.</p>
<p>Nobody is going to give you peace, not God, because you are not worthy of it. You have made this sorrowful confusion, and hope lies in you alone, not in a system, not in a leader, but in yourself alone.</p>
<p>Questioner: More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of! Mahatma Gandhi has wonderfully exemplified its efficacy in his daily life. If individuals without distraction and materialistic aggrandizement lift their hearts to God in penitent prayer, then the mercy of God will dispel the catastrophe that has overtaken the world. Is it not the right attitude to develop?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: You alone are responsible for this catastrophe and you alone can dispel it, not an outside agency, however great.</p>
<p>We must differentiate between prayer and meditation. What do we mean by prayer? As it is generally understood and practiced, it is a form of supplication or petition; you are in need and you pray; you are in confusion, in sorrow, and you pray. To whom are you praying? To God, you say. But God or truth is the unknown: that which cannot be formulated cannot be created. It must come to you, you cannot go to it; you may not beg of it, petition it; it must seek you out. When you seek it, when you pray to it, you create it, and what you create is not truth, God. The peace of truth shatters the peace that you crave.</p>
<p>God cannot give you peace for the god that you seek is fabricated out of your own mind, and when you pray to it, it does produce certain results: what you ask you receive, but you have to pay for it as in the fairy tales. If you pray for peace you will have it, but it will be the peace of decay, of death. Peace is creative, dynamic, and it does not come into being through supplication. Prayer is wholly different from meditation. He who prays cannot comprehend what is meditation, for he is concerned with gain. Meditation is understanding; understanding does not come through books, through following an example, but through self-knowledge which is a process of self-discovery. Meditation is an awareness of the whole process of living, not merely of any one part of existence - to be aware of every thought, feeling, and action.</p>
<p>Meditation is not concentration; meditation is all-inclusive, whereas concentration is exclusive. Focusing your attention on images made by the hand or by the mind, excluding all other thoughts, images, feelings, is not meditation. The excluding process of concentration is comparatively easy and futile. Meditation is an awareness extending ever deeply and widely through the clear perception of the many layers of consciousness. Prayer, concentration, and meditation are different processes, each having a different end. Prayer and concentration do not open the door of reality; meditation born of self-knowledge opens the door to the immeasurable, to the eternal. Those who are caught in the gratification of prayer and in the concentrated interest of exclusiveness cannot know the purifying significance of meditation. Spontaneity is essential for self-knowledge; spontaneous response reveals the ways of the mind and the heart. When there is no condemnation, no judgment, no identification, awareness reveals the significance of every thought and feeling. Awareness flows into meditation, in which the thinker and the thought are one, without the division between the thinker and his thought. Right meditation brings about stillness, absolute stillness of the mind, uninduced and free. Only then can reality come into being.</p>
<p>Questioner: You deride the Brahmins. Have they not played an important part in the culture of India?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: They have, but what of it? Surely the question reveals hereditary pride in the questioner, does it not? This hereditary ownership and pride has done a great deal of harm to society, to the relationship of man and man. What is of the greatest importance is what you are now, not what you were in the past. There were people in every country who were not driven by ambition, unconcerned with power and position, with property and systems, but vitally occupied in the pursuit of the real; they were above and beyond the clamor of society and the state and so were the teachers and helpers of man in strife, in sorrow. They were the guides of mankind, the Brahmins of old. But what has happened to them who, being free, were able to help man to think rightly? They have become merchants, lawyers, politicians, soldiers. Can there be true culture when man is solely occupied with sensate values?</p>
<p>So what matters is not the past but the result of the past, which is the present, you. To understand the past, the present is of the highest significance; the present is the door to the past. If the present is used as a mere passage to the future, then you are preparing for catastrophe, for untold misery and degradation.</p>
<p>Because in ancient days there were a group of people who were free from ambition and authority, from the bondages of greed and ill will, it helped to guide society away from spiritual and moral degradation. The larger the group, the greater the security of the society, of the state, and for this reason only one or two countries, like India, have survived. Because there are very few who are not caught up in the turmoil of the world, the world, you, are in an extraordinary crisis. To bring order and peace out of this mad confusion and misery, you must go above and beyond the causes that have produced this decay. You must be that one who is above all caste and creed, who is free from ambition and ill will, from authority and greed, from intrigue and worldliness. You alone, enlightened, can lay the foundation for a new culture - a culture that is freed from geographic and racial, national and organized religious bondages, a culture that is not of the East nor of the West, Hindu or Buddhist, Christian or Mohammedan.</p>
<p>To seek the eternal is to be freed from the bondages of time and misery. A very grave responsibility lies upon those who are not immediately concerned with food, clothing, and shelter. To bring about a new culture based on eternal values, there must be revolution in your mind and heart. Mere intellectual formulations, pride of hereditary distinctions and possessions are utterly useless, harmful; they cannot solve the world chaos and misery. In you is the only hope.</p>
<p>Questioner: You have attained illumination, but what about us, the millions?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: It is not at all important who has attained, but it is very essential to be aware of your own state. The mass is you; the millions are you and I. Despair and confusion, conflict and sorrow surround us; you and I have contributed towards this despair and decay, and none can solve the problems of the world except yourself. Not the illumined, not the leader, neither the temple nor the church; neither a guru nor a system can deliver you, the world, from conflict and sorrow. You alone can solve the problem: it cannot be solved for you by another.</p>
<p>Be aware of the causes of sorrow and strife in yourself and resolve them. Do not talk of saving the mass or safeguarding the millions, for the mass is yourself. Be aware of your sorrow, of your emptiness, of your own confusion, for what you are, the world is. Your problem is the world's problem. To bring about happiness and peace in the world, there must be fundamental transformation of your mind and heart.</p>
<p>You are life and action, and without understanding yourself, to attempt to solve the problems of another or of the world is to bring more confusion, more misery. The regeneration of the world lies in your own hands, for you are the world.</p>
