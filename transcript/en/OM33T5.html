<p>The vast majority of people come to listen to me or go to a church or search out teachers in order to be helped, to be guided, or to gain something which will give them satisfaction. In other words, when we talk of being helped, we want and we desire to come to a certain state of mentality, in which we shall find satisfaction. So we are always looking for a result, when we talk of being helped. To me, as I explained a few days ago, to be helped in this manner is absolutely transient and worthless.</p>
<p>So, having gained what we seek, either happiness, a solution to a problem, or the satisfaction of achievement or success, then we want to propagate and we want to coerce others to that pattern to which we have arrived. We want to coerce other people, to awaken other people to that point of view. We call that helping the world, bringing another to a particular point of view in which we have found satisfaction, and which has given us a certain contentment, which has given a sense of success, a sensation. So, having gained something, you ask yourself, “What shall I do with it? How shall I use it? In what manner can I use it to bring other people to the same attitude of mind?”</p>
<p>So, one is concerned with the result, not with what one has. You are concerned with how you shall use what you gain, and thereby with propaganda, talk, your convictions, you are urging others to come to your point of view. This has no value at all because you only want them to come to a certain point of view which you have arrived at and which has given you satisfaction. Action then has no value at all. To bring other people to a certain point of view, to awaken others to a certain result, is to me the formation of a sect. To awaken people to a certain point of view and to propagate for that point of view, you are concerned not with sowing that which you have, but with the result of your sowing.</p>
<p>If you have something in your basket, if you have your hands full, your mind and heart free, then you are concerned with sowing, not with the result which you may reap. When most people want to help, that is exactly what they are seeking. They want a result. Thereby, you are concerned not with the chief thing, which is the sowing, but what you shall reap. Please see this point, because I have listened to people, their questions have shown me, that you look at everything from a sectarian point of view, from a group point of view. You try to awaken other people to a certain point of view, to a certain pattern, to a certain result, which you yourself have achieved, or you consider how you shall sow that which you have. All this, to me, shows a very limited mind, and such a mind cannot understand the swiftness of wisdom.</p>
<p>Now, we are concerned with the result of sowing, because we are not sure what we are sowing. We want conviction from others to encourage us, to show that we have it. That gives us a sensation.</p>
<p>What I want to show this morning is that if you have come here to be helped to discover a solution, or to gain something, I am afraid you will be disappointed, because what you gain you lose. If you seek a result, it is transient. If you seek a solution, you are trying to run away from the cause of the problem. In other words, a result or a gain or the idea of achievement is but a certain comfort in which you take shelter, which becomes your security, and which you call truth. Hence your action - which alone can reveal the full significance of life - is utterly denied. You only seek a result, when there is an emptiness, an aching insufficiency.</p>
<p>Why do we seek a result? Why do we seek achievement? Because we cannot meet life or experience or every incident of the day completely, with a freshness. Because we have not the capacity to meet all things freshly, newly, spontaneously. Our minds are so burdened with memory, we are incapable of meeting anything fresh. We always meet events with ready-made reactions, born of yesterday’s memories.</p>
<p>When the mind and the heart are burdened with a memory of incompleteness, then we seek a result, a success, an achievement. Whereas, when you meet all things anew, with a freshness, with an eagerness, not with that ready-made reaction, that jaded memory, then that action will give you its full significance. You no longer seek a result, an achievement; you no longer run away from sensation. In action itself there is the full significance, and that is wisdom.</p>
<p>To follow that wisdom, your heart and mind must be entirely free from the search for a result. When one recognizes that, when one becomes aware in action that one is continually seeking a result, a success, an achievement, a gain - when you really understand with your mind as well as with your heart - then your everyday action reveals in what manner your mind and your heart are caught up. But now you are acting without consciousness, or full understanding of why you are doing it. Most of our actions are based on a motive, achievement, success, or fear. When you become conscious of that not only mentally, but emotionally as well, then that action of which you are conscious, aware, frees itself from the result which you are seeking. I will try to put it differently.</p>
<p>Don’t say, “I must not seek a result.” Don’t say, “I must not have achievement, or I must not seek shelter.” If you say that, you are creating another set of shelters. In the “must not” there is a shelter, there is a security. So, do not say that. Become aware if your action is the result of that search, of the want to gain security. When you become aware in action, then action itself will show you its full significance. After all, wisdom is not a thing to be gained out of books.</p>
<p>I cannot transmit wisdom to you. Wisdom is born in the fullness of action, and you can only act fully or understand action completely, when your mind and heart are free from this continual desire for a result. So, if you say you must not seek an achievement or a success, you do not understand action. Whereas, you will understand action with all its significance, if you become aware of the cause of your action.</p>
<p>Now, to become aware of the cause of action, is not to go through self-analysis. To me, self-analysis is destructive. But to be fully conscious, to be awake - both mentally and emotionally - when you are acting, then you will know the cause of your action. When you are conscious of your action, then you will understand the full significance of your search for a result, which will of its own accord reveal its transience. What I want to show is, what I want to explain is, that we should be concerned with sowing, not with its result. And the result will be right, if you sow rightly.</p>
<p>Now, we are concerned with the result of our sowing, and hence valuelessness of our action, and we do that because we are empty, because there is no sufficiency in each one of us. So we are concerned with all the results of our action. Such a mind cannot understand wisdom or the swiftness of truth. A mind that can meet all things afresh, anew, without the burden of memory, such a mind, in its fullness, in its plentitude, is only concerned with sowing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Some people call you a mystic, as opposite to an occultist, as they call it, because you do not lay so much emphasis on the improvement of the “bodies.” Please, will you change this bad reputation of yours, for it gives me a lot of work, even quarrels, to defend you. I am tired of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First of all, don’t defend another, especially with regard to this kind of thing. You know, when there is completeness there is no division, there are no opposites. It is only when the mind is insufficient in itself, it creates opposites, as mysticism and occultism. To me, a man who is caught up in mysticism, as opposed to occultism, can never understand what the truth is. You cannot divide life up as mystic and occult. It is a complete whole, it is a fullness, a plentitude. You cannot break it up and say, this is one side of it, and that is the other. It is only when the mind and heart are entirely free from all opposites that you will understand what that enduring action is. We create opposites because we choose, and our choice is always based on “dislike” and “like,” on a prejudice. Therefore, there is no direct discernment and opposites are created; I choose this, because I like it. Therefore, in choosing what I like, I create another opposite which I don’t like, and so I am caught up continually in this circle of likes and dislikes; and we choose because we are urged through the desire to gain, to achieve. Therefore, such a desire blinds our choice, and hence we create opposites in which we are caught up.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Can you describe briefly: a.) how the world looks to you as one who has attained the ecstasy of living? b.) how it would look to you, were all, or many of your hearers and readers, to realize liberation and live completely? If this is not possible, the reason why, would doubtless be interesting and instructive.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Do you know, I never thought about it. I never thought what it would look like, the world, if we all obtained liberation, what would be the result. Whether we should have perfect communism or perfect fascism. You see, I do not know, first of all, why the questioner has put it.</p>
<p>There are one or two possibilities why he has put it. He wants to know what the world looks like as a result of a few people’s achievement. That is, he wants to force others to a certain pattern, not let people be free in themselves. Therefore, I have never examined for myself what the result would be. I am concerned with sowing, not with reaping and who shall benefit.</p>
<p>If you are a prisoner, I am not concerned in describing what freedom is. My chief concern is to show what creates the prison and for you to break it down, if you are interested. If you are not, of course that is your own affair.</p>
<p>If you say that truth must be useful, it must be beneficial to others, then you do not understand. It will be, but if it is your concern, it will not be. That is why this question is put to me. You want to know what the result will be. It is impossible to tell you, because the result can never be discovered, because it will always be changing; it is not a set thing to which you come. At present one is a slave to so many legislations, one is a cog in a huge machine, spiritual, economical, social, in every way. When you are really free, that is, when you discover its true value, not run away from it or break away from it; when you discover the true value of this social standard in which you are a prisoner, then you will be free of all legislation, and you will not conform. There will be no idea of conformity to truth or to a description of truth which this questioner desires.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>To a loving honeymoon couple the world is, at least temporarily, transformed into a beautiful one, by their happiness. Does this in any way illustrate what you mean by the world problem being the individual problem?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You know, when we are caught up in a sensation, that sensation gives us so much pleasure that the world takes on a different hue. We have covered the world with a particular sensation which we have. In our transiency of happiness, we look at the world through that film of happiness.</p>
<p>What I mean by the world problem as being the individual problem is this: We have created through centuries, through particular desires, cravings, a certain set of rules, standards, to which we have unconsciously become slaves. We have through centuries sought security - economic, social, spiritual - in every way. To that security, which we have individually created, we have become slaves. We are unconscious wholly of that slavery. When you begin to question and to find out the true values of that social standard, of those prison bars that hold you, and by questioning and discovering the true value, you as an individual, free yourself from it. That is what I mean by world problem and individual problem. You may, through fear, create another set of rules, standards, that man shall not possess or have any security. What have you done? You have only moved from possession to nonpossession. That has become your prison. Whereas, if you truly discovered the value, the true significance of possession, which is born out of fear, then you will be free of possession and nonpossession as opposites. Then you will be free of all legislation, of all false standards, that society has set up. And you can only be that, when you are wholly individual, not individualistic.</p>
<p>To me, the true individual is one who discovers true values, eternal values of all things; and I say there are eternal values which neither I nor another can give you. No one can give you true values. You have to find out for yourself and when you have discovered the true value of all things, then you will act in your aloneness, in your sufficiency, in your completeness; in that there is ecstasy. But, if you are merely satisfied to live as a cog in the machine, then there is nothing to be said. I do not want you to awaken to a certain standard; I would wish that, if I wanted you to conform. You can only discover true values, when you are really in a crisis, when you are really demanding. Most spiritual people, at least people who think they are spiritual, try to demand a satisfaction. They are all the time avoiding this demand which shows the true significance of all their actions and thoughts. That can only come if there is tremendous discontent, not when the mind is dulled to sleep by contentment or the picture of peace, which you call truth.</p>
<p>Now don’t turn round and say, “If I wake up to this prison, will it have an influence in the world? Will the world be any better because I, as an individual, have discovered the true value? Will the world benefit by it?” Then you are not discovering true value, you are only discovering what will be useful for the world. If you discover the true value, it will be beyond this, it will be eternal, and therefore applicable to all men.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>In order to achieve “release of life” should we acknowledge a duality, a separation between “life” and our physical, emotional, and mental inertia, in order to face the latter as something to be dissolved?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why do you have to acknowledge something of which you are conscious? If you are not conscious of separation, then there is no conflict. If you are not aware of duality, then there is no struggle; there is a harmonious reaction. But as most people are aware of that conflict, why need there be an acknowledgment of separation? You see, you don’t acknowledge the separation which causes conflict, because you are seeking a solution of the conflict. Because we are trying to escape from the conflict, we are not aware that there is duality in our actions. Because we are seeking comfort, security, running away from this fear of loneliness, we have to mentally acknowledge the existence of a duality.</p>
<p>When there is a conflict, what happens? You want to seek an escape from it, a way out of it. You never find out what is the cause of this conflict. You will find out the true cause of the conflict, when you are conscious or when you are aware fully, not when you inquire mentally what is the cause of the conflict. You will find out the cause of conflict, of pain and suffering, only when you really want to find out with your mind as well as with your heart.</p>
<p>Now, most people only want to find out the cause mentally, and therefore whatever they discover will only be false, because they do not approach the cause fully. You approach the cause only fully, when there is a crisis, when it consumes you, when all your escapes are blocked. That is why I said become conscious, become aware; then you will see how your mind is trying to escape from facing the cause, or trying to see a solution, running away, forgetting. So you gradually begin to stop up all those avenues of escape and security, and then you will face it with your whole being. That is true awareness. In that, you will find out the true cause.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Sometimes I am totally indifferent, nothing interests me; I even do not want to be happy. How could I get out of this condition of inertia?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There are two possibilities: one that you are physically, mentally, emotionally tired; or, which is more probable, you have filled your mind and your heart with a lot of rubbish, as you fill a wastepaper basket. When the mind is full with useless, transient things, it can get very tired and that is probably the main reason - sheer exhaustion from the collection of useless things, like the rich man has. Now you have collected it, the next thing is to empty it; that is if you are interested. If you empty that mind of useless things, you will discover the everlasting. If your action is born from that rubbish, then your action will ever be futile and worthless, finite; if your action is born from that transient, useless rubbish, which you have collected, false values, that action will have no value at all.</p>
<p>So, you have to discover if you are acting from that rubbish. That is why I say: Become fully aware of your action, of what you are doing, and then you will discover true value in that rubbish itself. You do not have to get rid of it, or start another wastepaper basket and fill it up again with more rubbish.</p>
<p>I hope you follow this, because that is what has happened to the majority of people. They have gone out in search of true values, of the truth, and they have collected and have been choosing: this is essential; this is not essential. They have accumulated, their mental granaries are full with things which they have considered of value, but which have turned to ashes. Hence there is sheer exhaustion, fatigue.</p>
<p>Now, do not destroy that granary and start another. You will, if you destroy it or try to conquer it. But if you become conscious, aware, if you see, if you observe both emotionally and mentally, that your actions are born from that memory, from that granary, from that collection, that accumulation, then you will see immediately, instantaneously, the cause of your action, and then you will know for yourself, instantaneously, the true value of that cause.</p>
<p>This is not a trick which you have to learn by heart and then it becomes another security, another phrase, about which you meditate and lose yourself. It is really very simple, if you really want to find out whether you are acting from rubbish, and therefore your action is valueless, or whether you are acting completely and hence, action is infinite.</p>
<p>You have memories, ideas, which you have stored up for ages, and you are acting from those; and hence, you do not meet anything freshly, anew. Now, if you become aware that you are thus acting, your action itself will reveal the cause. And in that discovery lies the true significance of your act, and then all action is free from motive. There is a repletion, there is a fullness, and in that there is ecstasy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Please tell me how to bring up children.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To me the child is not the important thing; the child is not important at all. It is the mother and the father and the teacher who are important, not the child. This is not just a clever statement. The child is there to be formed anyhow, as you will, a pliable thing like putty. So it is not how you are to bring up the child; it is what you are yourself, whether you are the teacher, mother, or father. Have you followed that? Then comes whether you as a parent believe in authority. If you are fully conscious of the futility of authority, then you will for yourself find out the true way. When you know for yourself the sheer valuelessness of authority, then you will find out how to discipline the child rightly.</p>
<p>See what the significance of having no authority means. You have authority only when there is fear. When you are free of fear, you are acting from completeness, which does not mean the opposite, lack of authority, which is a negation. After all, that is how we bring up a child, don’t we? - on authority, “must and must not,” “don’t and do,” or give wrong explanations of things which we ourselves fear.</p>
<p>The other day a mother told her child, when asked about death, that there is reincarnation, and the child was satisfied. What have you done, when you have given such an explanation? You have created a security for yourself in reincarnation, and you have merely transferred it to the child. And so you have already begun to build in that child’s mind the idea of security; so you have established an authority. When you understand the significance of what authority means, then you will not make the child licentious or let it do exactly what it likes. That is not the point. You know that this is such an immense subject that one must take things one by one. First of all authority.</p>
<p>Authority implies conformity to a certain regulation, certain moral law, a certain standard - the true significance of which you, the parent or the teacher, have not yourself tested. So you say, “This is right and this is wrong,” and you have helped to build up, based on authority, certain ideas in the mind. So, what you are doing now is merely transferring, transmitting to that child, all the false values which you yourself have accumulated.</p>
<p>I say there will be false values as long as you are not examining, so long as you as an individual have not found out the true significance. So, when you say you are bringing up the child, you are merely handing down to it all your false conceptions. Therefore I say, find out for yourself if you as an individual, as a mother or a father or a teacher, really believe in authority.</p>
<p>You know authority does not just mean “Do,” or “Do not,” you must find out the whole significance of it - authority of spirituality, the authority of laws - authority with all its nuances. Then when you have found out for yourself, or are in the process of finding out the true significance for yourself, you are creating for the child a new condition. You cannot help doing so. Not that you are going to succeed at once with the complete freedom from authority, because you yourself are not free from it. But if you are really attempting to free your mind from false values, there is a pliability, a swiftness, an adjustment. Then you will be able to meet the child.</p>
