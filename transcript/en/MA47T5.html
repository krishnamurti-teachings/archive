<p>It would be of deep significance if you and I together could make the journey into self-knowledge, into self-exploration. But the difficulty with most of us is that we are merely observers rather than partakers; we would rather watch the play than be the players. It would be highly beneficial if each one could be a player and not be the mere spectator, as one who is thinking, feeling, living. The difficulty with most of us is that we do not know how to share in discovering for ourselves. We are not accustomed to discover for ourselves the process of our own thinking, from which alone right action can take place. Is it possible not to be mere spectators, but actually partake in what is being explored? Only in this manner can you and I establish a full communicable relationship between us. Most of us have a verbal relationship, but the difficulty lies in going beyond it to a deeper level in which alone there can be understanding. Communication can exist only when there is mutual understanding; if you understand and I do not, then communication between us ceases. To establish the right kind of communication on the same level at the same time is arduous. It would be of significant value if you and I together could explore into the ways of the self; and it would be utterly futile to describe to you the results of my journey.</p>
<p>One problem is the search for happiness and the overcoming of sorrow. We crave for happiness and yet sorrow is our constant companion. Though we must have struggled often with this problem, yet let us examine it anew, as though we were considering it for the first time. No problem is old, for every problem is undergoing a constant change. Let us be aware together of this problem of sorrow and happiness, at the same time and on the same level; do not merely listen to me and take on a communication which is not your own, for these talks, if listened to rightly, will bring about deeper and wider awareness.</p>
<p>We seek happiness through things, through relationship, through thoughts, ideas. So things, relationship, and ideas become all-important and not happiness. When we seek happiness through something, then the thing becomes of greater value than happiness itself. When stated in this manner, the problem sounds simple, and it is simple. We seek happiness in property, in family, in name; then property, family, idea become all-important, for then happiness is sought through a means, and then the means destroys the end. Can happiness be found through any means, through anything made by the hand or by the mind? Things, relationship, and ideas are so transparently impermanent, we are ever made unhappy by them. We seek happiness through things and we do not find it there; in relationships we search for it and neither do we find happiness there, for there is impermanency in relationship though we try to take refuge in it; again we try to find happiness in thought, in ideas, in belief, and neither is it there, for one set of ideas can be destroyed by another, one belief overcome by another. Things are impermanent, they wear out and are lost; relationship is constant friction and death awaits; ideas and beliefs have no stability, no permanency. We seek happiness in them and yet do not realize their impermanency. So sorrow becomes our constant companion and overcoming it our problem.</p>
<p>We have never asked ourselves if happiness can be found through things made by the hand or by the mind. Is not sorrow inevitable as long as happiness is not the means and the end itself? Can happiness be found at all? Can it exist in itself? There is happiness only when the search for it ceases. To find out the true meaning of happiness, we must explore the river of self-knowledge. Self-knowledge is not an end in itself. Is there a source to a stream? Every drop of water from the beginning to the end makes the river. To imagine that we will find happiness at the source is to be mistaken. It is to be found where you are on the river of self-knowledge.</p>
<p>To follow the river of the conscious and unconscious thoughts and feelings, motives and demands, is very arduous. Those of you who have listened earnestly must have attempted to be aware of every thought and feeling and so perceive their significance. In this manner, the conscious mind is cleared of its conflicts, confusions, and antagonisms so as to receive the hidden thoughts and intimations. To follow the deep river of self-knowledge there must be the clarification of the conscious, the awareness of what is actually happening. By being aware of the conscious activities, the hidden thoughts and pursuits are understood. The conscious is the present, the now, and through the present the hidden is comprehended; the hidden can only be understood through being intensely yet passively aware of the present, thus thought frees itself from its own self-created tribulations and hindrances. The conscious mind is occupied with the immediate problems of existence; without understanding these problems, thought and feeling cannot proceed to deeper and wider issues. The conscious mind is occupied with the daily problems of life: property, class division, relationship, and so on. These problems weave in and out of the conscious mind; the conscious mind is made up of these problems, and if thought does not free itself from its self-imposed travail, it cannot proceed into deeper depths of self-knowledge. To follow the river of self-knowledge, the first step, which is the most difficult, must be taken, for the beginning of self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom. Happiness is not to be found through any means, but self-knowledge itself is joy. Love is its own eternity, so self-knowledge is happiness.</p>
<p>Questioner: I have been told that you do not read any philosophical or religious literature. I can hardly credit this, as when I listen to you I realize that you must have read, or have, some secret source of knowledge. Please be frank.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: I have not read any philosophical, psychological, or religious literature, neither the Bhagavad-Gita nor the Upanishads. The secret source is in oneself, for you and I are the repositories of knowledge; we are the reservoir of all thought and wisdom. You and I are the results of the past, of time, and in understanding ourselves we uncover all knowledge and wisdom. Self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom, and we can and must discover truth through self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Wisdom cannot be bought; neither is it to be found through sacrifice nor does it lie in any book, however sacred. Truth does not come by following any system, any leader, any guru. It comes into being when there is passive awareness, when the mind is alertly receptive. There is a delight, there is an ecstasy incomparable, when there is self-knowledge. But most minds are drugged with the thoughts of others, and imitation and repetition are inevitable. When you quote the Bhagavad-Gita, or the Bible, or the Koran, or some so-called sacred book of China, or some modern philosopher or economist, you are merely repetitive. What is true cannot be repeated, and if repeated, quoted, it ceases to be the truth; it becomes a lie. A lie can be propounded, propagated, but not truth; when a truth becomes an instrument of propaganda, then it ceases to be true.</p>
<p>Self-knowledge is not a conclusion, an end; it has no beginning and no end. You must begin where you are, reading every word, every phrase, every paragraph of the book of self-knowledge. To understand its contents there must be no condemnation, no justification, for all identification and denial put an end to the stream of self-knowledge. To be awake to the movement of the self, there must be a certain freedom, a spontaneity, for a thought that is disciplined, controlled, molded, can never pursue the swift current of the self. A disciplined mind is shaped in a mold, and so cannot follow the subtle promptings of the different layers of consciousness. But there are rare moments when the disciplined mind, the drugged mind, is spontaneous, and in these moments there is a comprehension of conditioned responses, when thought can go beyond its own limitations.</p>
<p>Wisdom is not in a book, it has no secret source. You will find the real very near; it is in yourself. But to discover it there must be the activity of constant alertness. When thought is passively aware, watching and following, then the map of self-knowledge unfolds itself. Self-knowledge is not by the study of the self in isolation, for there is no isolation. To live is to be related, and isolation is merely escape. If thought is alertly passive, watching its own movements and flutters, then when sleep comes the conscious mind is capable of receiving the hints and intimations of the hidden consciousness. He who desires to discover the real, the eternal, must put aside every book, every system, every guru, for that which is can be uncovered only through self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Questioner: In this country, at present, our government is attempting to modify the system of education. May we know your ideas on education and how it can be imparted?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: This is a complex subject, and to spend a few minutes in trying to understand the problem seems quite absurd, for its implications are vast. There is great joy in perceiving things clearly. Let us not become entangled and confused with the notions and ideas of others, whether it be the governments, the specialists, or the learned.</p>
<p>What has happened to the world after centuries of so-called education? There have been wars, destruction, and misery; two most catastrophic wars have almost destroyed the structure man has built through his education. We see education has failed, as it has produced the most dreadful destruction and misery that the world has ever known. The state, the government, are now controlling education; thus they will be assured of what you think, for if you were taught how to think, then you would become a danger to the government, to the state. When the state controls or guides education, there must be regimentation to produce efficiency, and as the modern world demands machines, not human beings, technical efficiency is essential. This is what is happening in the world, is it not? Education has been controlled by religious organizations, by priests, and now it is the government, the state. The result of this education has been disasters and misery for man, and the exploitation of man. Exploitation of man by organization, religion, or by the state is still exploitation and sorrow for man. Man being stronger than the system, he eventually breaks it up but unfortunately falls into another system. There is no hope for man as long as education is in the hands of the priests, or of the government, or it is in the hands of those who use education as a means of exploiting man for their party or for their profit.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of education, what is the purpose of living? If this is not clear, education has no significance. Education cannot be divorced from life, which is a total process. Does education vary from period to period, depending on the environment, the religious or the industrial? Is education mere adjustment to the immediate demands of environment? If it is, then the job is far more important than man himself; then the machine, the system, is far more significant than man himself. And this is what is happening in the world at the present time.</p>
<p>If the significance of man himself is not understood, then education will have no meaning at all; then man will be a thing used by the state, by the religion, by the party for a system and so on. If you do not know what is the purpose of existence, of life, then why bother how you are educated? If you do not know what is your significance, then you become cannon fodder or a target for atomic bombs. If that is the end purpose of man, then we must make ourselves extremely efficient to kill each other. There are more armies than ever before, more money spent on armaments and new ways of destruction than ever before, and there are more technicians and sergeants. Yet, there is more education than before. The scientist is caught in his laboratory, the businessman in his markets, the addicts in their specializations, and neither they nor we are aware of the significance of life.</p>
<p>What is the significance of existence? What is the purpose of this strife and confusion, of this misery and ache? If we do not know that, then education has very little meaning. The purpose of existence is to be free from strife and sorrow, to be free so that the real - the eternal - can be, to be free so that there can be happiness. He who is happy ceases to do mischief in the world; he who loves ceases to possess, to divide. A happy man, who loves and has peace in his heart, is free from all systems, political and religious; he is not the cause of misery and exploitation. To find reality there must be freedom from conditioned thinking and responses, freedom from craving which conditions thought and feeling.</p>
<p>Does freedom come through any system of education, either of the left or of the right? Can parents, the environment, give freedom? No systems can free thought; a system by its very nature is binding. The means creates the end, a thought trained in a system is not free. Environment, the parent, the teacher, are extraordinarily important; the educator must be educated. If the educator is confused, narrow, stupid, bound by superstitions, ancient or modern, then he will shape the thought of the child according to the pattern of his stupidity. So the education of the educator is far more important than the education of the child. Does the educator seek self-knowledge from which comes right thinking, which alone can bring about a revolution in values? Almost all the parents and educators do not desire the revolution in values based on right thinking; they seek security, they desire the continuance of things as they are, with certain vague modifications.</p>
<p>It is much more difficult to educate the educator than the child, for the educator has already grown stupid. He is confused, he seeks systems as a means of educating the child, and he is driven from one system to another; he will not find the best system, for he is the educator, not the system. If he is confused and ignorant, without self-knowledge, he is incapable of cultivating intelligence in another. The child is the result of his parents; he is the product of the past in conjunction with the present. The idea that, given freedom, the child will develop naturally, intelligently, seems fallacious, as after all, the child is not wholly free from conditioned responses. How can the educator awaken intelligence in the child, if the educator himself is ignorant of his conditioning? Most of us have no love for our children, though we use that word frequently. Without love, can you understand another? Without love, can you educate another? Without love, the system becomes all-important, which turns out machines, not human beings. Love is immediate communion and understanding on the same level at the same time, and because hearts are withered, we turn to systems, governmental or religious, as a means of freeing thought and awakening intelligence. Because we do not love, the educator, the environment become all-important, and as the educator is like us, he too has no love and so he depends on systems, on the mere cultivation of the intellect. Is not negative thinking the highest form of comprehension? Wisdom is not the positive acquisition of knowledge, nor the accumulation of facts. Wisdom comes with self-knowledge, and without self-knowledge there is no right thinking. Systems and blueprints of education cannot solve the conflict and misery of man. The love of systems destroys love, and without love there can be no right thinking; there can be no creation. The efficacy and the efficiency of love is greater than the efficiency of the machine.</p>
<p>Questioner: The traditional method of reaching the adepts or the Masters by training given by man, or through their disciples, is still said to be open to humanity. Are your teachings intended for those who are on that path?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: There is no path to reality. Reality is not to be found through any path; it is to be found through the uncharted sea of self-knowledge; the immeasurable is not to be measured by the path of the known.</p>
<p>What is known is not the true. What is known is caught in the net of time. A path can only lead to the known. The path to your house, to your village, you know - for you know your abode, your destination. But to the immeasurable there is no path, for the real is not to be formulated, and if it is formed, it ceases to be the real. What you have learned from books regarding truth is not the true. A truth that is repeated ceases to be true. It is only a lie that can be repeated, not truth.</p>
<p>You say that all paths lead to truth, but is that so? Do the path of the ignorant and the path of the man of ill will lead to truth? He must abandon ignorance and ill will to find truth. A man who is concerned with murder in the name of the state - can he find truth unless he abandons his trade? A man who is addicted to knowledge - can he find truth? Must he not put aside his addiction to find it? A man of division will not find truth. All paths do not lead to truth; the part will not lead to the whole.</p>
<p>Will the man of action uncover reality? He will not, for his approach is incomplete. Knowledge, devotion, and action, as three separate paths, cannot lead to truth, but only to illusion, destruction, and to restlessness. The very search for reality demands self-knowledge, devotion, and action. The man of mere action can never uncover truth, nor the man of mere devotion, nor the man who is merely pursuing knowledge. The men of action, of devotion, of knowledge, are not free, for their various activities are self-created and so binding; remove the object of their action and they are lost, a devotee is lost without the object of his devotion.</p>
<p>Wisdom does not come along any path; no Master or his pupil can give you wisdom, happiness. The very division of a Master and a disciple is a source of ignorance and conflict. The special few and their path is vanity, and they pay the price for their security. It is the immature that feel that they are the chosen, that cling to their way, to their action. The mature, the integrated, can come to enlightenment. A man who is committed to a particular action, to a way of life, will not be able to receive the eternal, for the part is ever committed to time.</p>
<p>Through misery you can never find happiness; misery must be understood and so set aside for happiness to be. For love to be, there must be no contention and confusion. Where there is darkness, there is no light, and light is when darkness is not. Love is when there are no possessions, when there is no condemnation, no self-fulfillment. You must become a beggar once again, as you were when you began your search. Do not get entangled in any path, nor lost in any organization. To a man who is earnest in his search after truth, the search itself is action, devotion, and knowledge. Through a crack in the wall, you do not see the whole, clear sky; you must be in the open to behold its beauty. There is hope for him who, abandoning all paths, seeks reality.</p>
<p>Questioner: What profession would you advise me to take?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: One thought is related to another, and no question, no problem is isolated. To understand this question, right thinking is necessary, and there is no right thinking without self-knowledge. Every action, every feeling and thought is interrelated; to think out one thought completely is to feel out, think out, all thought. What is happening here at present? Can you choose the profession you like? You take what you can get and you are lucky if you can get one. Since we have lost all values save one, the sensate, there is utter confusion in the world. You go through difficult studies to become an automaton in an office; the structure of society is built on mutual destruction. The society is geared to destroy; all professions contribute to war. A society is degenerate when the soldier, the policeman, the lawyer are in abundance. A soldier's job is to kill, and his very existence is a continuation of war. Can you choose such a profession? The policeman's lot is not happy; he is there to spy, to report, to watch, to intrigue. Can you choose such a profession? The lawyer, a cunning man without substance, by his cleverness sustains division, flourishes in conflict; he becomes the politician, capable in dealing with superficialities. The politician can never bring peace to the world. Can you choose such a profession? Can you choose these professions that live and thrive on disunity and on suffering? They do not live on kindness and love, but on human stupidity, greed, and ill will. Can you join with him who is gathering wealth through exploitation, through cupidity, through ignorance? So you see how limited our choice is. A doctor, a technician, an artist - they too have their troubles, their misery.</p>
<p>Right thinking alone can bring about a good society whose activities will not be harmful to man. There cannot be right thinking without self-knowledge. Are you willing to spend time to know yourself, to think rightly, which will create a new society? Those of you who are not caught in the immediate task of seeking a job can do something, those of you who have leisure can cultivate right thinking, and so bring about a good society. This responsibility lies on such people. But those who can do not search out right thinking. Right thinking alone can bring about right action; self-knowledge yields right thinking.</p>
