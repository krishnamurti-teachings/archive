<p>It is important to be aware of the art of listening. Most of us listen with a bias or with a mind stuffed with conclusions, with beliefs, and with so-called knowledge; we listen through the noisy mutterings of our own minds, or we listen so inattentively that we hardly understand what is being said. The right relationship between the listener and the speaker is always difficult, for the relationship is temporary and superficial, a brief contact and separation. But I hope these gatherings will not be of that nature, for during these talks each one is gathering knowledge about himself and so able to think rightly. You are not merely listening to a talk and going back to your old form of existence, but awakening to your whole being, you will be able to shatter your old forms of thoughtlessness and habits.</p>
<p>I would request you not to listen to these talks with the idea of learning but let what I am saying take root. If what is being said is true, then it will stand firmly and take root deeply, but if it is false it will fall off and wither away. So what is important is to listen with alert and yet easeful attention to these talks which should be a part of our daily life, and not merely a thing which you attend once a week. These talks are meant to awaken and to quicken intelligence and not to give you conclusions; for conclusions, like belief, prevent the fruition of thought and intelligence.</p>
<p>We were saying: Why is it that each one of us, and so the world, has given an all-consuming significance to property and psychological separation? Why is it that each one gives such enormous importance to acquisitiveness and to social, national, and racial divisions? Why is it that almost all our problems revolve around possessions and name? I do not know if you are aware of this issue in your daily life, but if you are, have you not asked yourself why is it that property with its many complexities - name, nationality, and other forms of divisions and exclusions - fill your mind? There must be some reason why your mind and heart are so occupied with these things, must there not be? Why is it that man goes to war, murdering each other over property and name? Why is it that he tries to solve the problems that property and name create through the same means? Is it not because he is seeking security? Food, clothing, and shelter are essential, but yet we seem to be incapable of giving man these essentials.</p>
<p>Because we have no greater value than acquisitiveness and class, these have become of extraordinary significance. The interest in something greater frees thought from the lesser, and then the lesser would not assume dominating value. Secondary values, when given dominating importance, bring disaster and misery, which is what is taking place now in the world. So why is there no greater value, though all the so-called sacred books assert that there is? You must seek the answer, must you not? Have you sought it?</p>
<p>You say you have but where has it led you? To greater division, to greater possessiveness. Why is there no greater value?</p>
<p>When the mind and heart seek security, certainty, there can be no greater value than the sensate. Acquisitiveness and the name and class are psychological; they are the result of psychological demands. When the mind is seeking security, it can only create values either made by the hand or by itself. So there can be no greater value than the values of the mind; hence, sensate values become the all-important. Legislation to curb acquisitiveness, with its results, is necessary, but that does not solve the problem; revolutions have come and gone, but we are still confronted with the same problem - acquisitiveness and class division. Confusion and misery are still here, and the pursuit of sensate value, either by the left or the right, will not give man order and peace.</p>
<p>How is the greater value to be found? For if you are interested in discovering something greater, then you will not give all-consuming importance to the secondary, to the less. As long as you have not found the greater, the secondary, the lesser becomes dominatingly significant. There is the discovery of the greater through understanding the psychological demand for security. The problem is not food, clothes, and shelter and their effective organization, but the psychological demand; for security, food, clothes, and shelter, the essentials, are used as a means to fulfill the psychological craving. Now, we have assumed that there is security, but is there such a thing as psychological security? We all seek it through different mediums, through things, through relationship, through ideas; the mind is in constant pursuit of security, certainty. On the assurance that there is psychological security, we have built our structure of existence. When the mind is seeking security, it must cling to the lesser values, the sensate values, and they become all-important.</p>
<p>The discovery of the truth of psychological security lies through self-knowledge. To discover what is beyond the known values, the sensory values, there must be self-knowledge. In the true inquiry of security, sensory values become of less importance. The truth of security is not to be found in its positive or negative assertion, but it is to be discovered only through direct perception, through self-knowledge. When truth is uncovered it brings great joy and clarity. Self-knowledge is important, as it reveals the fundamental truth of our problem, the truth of security. Self-knowledge is a creative process as long as the mind is not using self-knowledge as a means of security or as an achievement. All relationship is a process of self-revelation and not a means towards security. If you are aware of your thoughts, feelings, and actions, they will reveal the ways of the self, which is ever seeking security,  certainty. If you are aware, you will perceive that in relationship the mind is seeking psychological security. Can relationship exist in insecurity? If there is uncertainty there is fear and deep inquiry. Certainty puts you to sleep. Self-knowledge becomes of great significance in the pursuit of the truth, of certainty, of permanency. The mind is ever seeking security, the known. If the mind is aware of its own ways of thinking, then it will perceive that it is always moving from the known to the known, from the secure to the secure. It creates from the known the unknown and worships it as the ultimate security, but what it has created is not the real. If you observe very diligently your own way of thinking and feeling, you will see that security is the end of its activities.</p>
<p>It is in freedom that the discovery of the real is made, not in security. Property and name become the all-important problem when we pursue security, certainty. The security in sensory values leads man to conflict and misery, but the truth of sensory values, which can be discovered only through self-knowledge, liberates man from sorrow and disaster.</p>
<p>Questioner: Will you please explain further what you mean by meditation?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: In perceiving truly what the problem is, understanding comes. The solution is in the problem, not away from it; understanding lies in the problem itself and not in the answer. What do we mean generally by meditation? We are not condemning meditation but examining what generally takes place in so-called meditation, for in perceiving the truth of what our activities are during meditation, we shall be set free to meditate rightly. You meditate because you have been told to, and action based on authority leads to confusion and conflict. Your mind wanders all over the place as you try to meditate; thought is as a shuttle weaving itself from the past through the present to the future and back again, ever restless, ever anxious, ever vagrant. By excluding all other ideas, thought tries to concentrate on the one idea that it has chosen, but swiftly other thoughts come pouring in; again you try to concentrate and again thought wanders off. Again and again you try to concentrate and fail once more. So you spend your time in conflict, in control, and not in so-called meditation. Or, in order to concentrate better you sit in front of a picture or repeat a phrase or a word or try to discover the deeper significance of a word. Developing virtue is also considered meditation. If one can fix one's mind on an idea and identify oneself with it completely, then it is considered a great spiritual achievement. This is generally what is considered meditation, is it not? This is what one generally attempts to do in so-called meditation, is it not?</p>
<p>The mind, being vagrant, disorderly, seeking security, orderliness, pursues an exclusiveness; if it can dwell upon it and identify itself with it, then there is gratification, a sense of achievement. The idea, the phrase, is made by man; the word is repeated by man. Repetition of a word, a phrase, or the gaze puts you in a self-induced trance; such a repetition dulls the mind. The identification with a self-projected idea, though intensely gratifying, is not the real. Reality is not to be formulated, cannot be thought about, for what is thought about is the known, and what is known is not the real. You can only think about the known; you cannot think about the unknown. The projection of the known and its worship is not meditation but a form of self-hypnosis. This form of self-hypnosis is a hindrance to the understanding of the real.</p>
<p>Thought is the result of the past, and what it thinks about is still of time. After all, the purpose of meditation is to uncover reality and not to hypnotize oneself about reality. The real is not uncovered through repetition of words and phrases, by dulling the mind through rituals and through concentration, which is an exclusive process. So, is it possible for the unknown to manifest itself? It is possible only when time, the known, has ceased. Memory, the records of experience, is the mind; the mind clings to memory, ever increasing and ever expanding. Memory becomes a hindrance for the unknowing. How would you find out that which is not formulatable, the immeasurable, the real? This is the problem of meditation, is it not? But meditation is not prayer, nor does concentration, the process of exclusion, lead to meditation. So how would you approach the understanding of meditation? The mind which is the result of the past, of the known - can it understand the timeless, the eternal? The timeless comes into being only when time has ceased. Truth can exist only when the known, the accumulated memory, has come to an end. Then how can the mind, the result of the past, free itself from the known? It is free only when thought is not caught in its own structure - in the word, in the phrase, in habit, in discipline, in routine, in belief, in dogma, in memory.</p>
<p>So it is not a question of how to meditate, which is a wrong question. The ''how'' implies a method; the method is the known; the known can only lead to the known; a wrong means leads to a wrong end. The end is in the means. If the means is known, the end is also the known, but the known is not the real. The real is only when thought is free from the known. The known is the accumulated and the power to accumulate knowledge, name, and things. Can thought free itself from accumulation, from its own creation? Yes. Can the mind, which is the result of the past, free itself from time? It can. It can free itself from time through the gateway of the present; the present is the thought, the feeling, the action - being aware of what you are thinking, feeling, doing now, in the immediate present. The present is the gateway to the timeless. By being aware of what you are thinking and feeling, you will perceive their ways only if there is no condemnation, no justification, no identification. For condemnation, justification, identification, prevent thought from completing itself. The constant awareness of your thought, feeling, and action, and your trained and spontaneous responses to them is the beginning of self-knowledge. The awareness of the conscious as well as the hidden activities is self-knowledge. The beginning of self-knowledge is the beginning of meditation. There is no meditation without self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Be aware choicelessly, that is, without condemnation, without justification, without pursuing; then there is the highest form of thinking, creative thinking. That which is creative is creation, the real.</p>
<p>Questioner: I am beginning to realize that I am very lonely. What am I to do? (Laughter)</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: I wonder why you laugh? Do you laugh because you despise loneliness or you consider it as bourgeois or as a thing not important? Because you are so socially occupied, or so concerned with reform that you consider loneliness as something unworthy of you, that you laugh. Can you laugh it away? It would be interesting to find out why you laugh. The awareness of that laughter is the beginning of self-knowledge. Self-knowledge leads to great heights and depths, and if it is pursued ever deeply and widely there is great tribulation leading to incredible happiness and ecstasy.</p>
<p>Do you know what loneliness means and are you aware of it? I doubt it, for you generally smother that pain of loneliness by every kind of action, by knowledge, by the conflicts of relationship, and by things. So you are not aware of ache, of loneliness. Loneliness is that sense of being as nothing, the frightening void, the state of extraordinary uncertainty, of having no refuge, no anchorage, an aching emptiness, an unfathomable frustration. Everyone has felt this loneliness - the happy and the unhappy, the very active and the addicts after knowledge - the inexhaustible pain, the pain that is ever there. We try to run away from it, try to cover it up, smother it, but it is ever there.</p>
<p>Again, let us approach this question not so much as to find an answer but to understand the problem itself. The problem is the realization of loneliness and what should be the action towards it. What happens actually when there is this ache of loneliness? You try to escape from it, you pick up a book, or go to a cinema, or turn on the radio, or discuss politics, lose yourself in various forms of activities; you worship or you pray, you paint or you write a poem about loneliness. Being aware of the pain and the fathomless fear, you escape from it according to your idiosyncrasies or temperament. So the means of escape become all-important - your gods, your knowledge, your activities, your radios. When you give predominant significance to secondary values, then there is confusion and misery; secondary values are invariably sensate, and modern civilization is based on secondary values.</p>
<p>Have you tried to be alone? To be alone demands a great deal of intelligence, for the mind is restless, active, caught in the net of its own desires. It is difficult for thought to be alone without escaping, to be aware of itself without conditioned responses. Thought, being aware of its own emptiness, tries to fill itself, this emptiness, with the known. We are attempting to fill that which we do not know, the void, with the known, with knowledge, with the responses of relationship and with things. Have you succeeded in filling this void, have you been successful in covering it? Obviously not. Can this emptiness, this void be filled? Having tried one escape and finding it useless, do we not find that all escapes are vain? Are not all escapes similar, and so is it not useless to seek different escapes? In understanding the uselessness of one escape, do not all escapes become futile?</p>
<p>What then is the right action in understanding this loneliness? There is an understanding of this aching void only when there is no longer any escape. When you are willing to face what is, turning your back on all escapes, turning your back on worldly values, then only is there the transformation of what is. The understanding of what is is the beginning of self-knowledge, of wisdom.</p>
<p>Questioner: Are you not becoming our leader?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: I have received several questions of this nature - that I should enter politics to lead India out of this present confusion and so on.</p>
<p>Why is it that you want a leader? Why do you become a leader and why become a follower? It does not matter whether the leader is political or religious, a guru. You are uncertain. You do not know what to think, you are confused, so you desire to be directed, to be protected, guided. This desire creates political tyranny and dictatorship, and religiously, the acceptance of authority, belief, tradition, which dulls the mind and heart. When there is inner and outer confusion, you seek and create leadership. There is confusion and misery, degradation and starvation; there is exploitation by the rich, by the clever, and by those who are possessed by systems, by formulas, and by those who breed different and antagonistic groups and parties. From this vast confusion you desire to be saved. So you create the leader and you become the follower; you hunger after leaders because inwardly and outwardly you want to be secure, protected from confusion. You fear to be uncertain and so you create authority. In doing this, you destroy yourself by becoming the follower. When you follow a party or a discipline, a leader or a guru, are you not destroying your own thought process?</p>
<p>Being confused and sorrowful, can anyone give you clarity and happiness? None can deliver you from confusion and sorrow save yourself, for you yourself have brought about this confusion and this misery. There is the right solution in the problem itself, and not away from it; in the confusion and misery itself, and not away from it. But you will not look at conflict and pain; all that you ask is to be led away from the understanding of what is. So you bring forth the leader to exploit and to be exploited. The leader fulfills himself by leading, by guiding, by intriguing, and manipulating, and he feels himself frustrated when thwarted; for he, like you, feeds on power and position. Exploitation exists not only between the worker and the owner, but also between the follower and the leader. You not only breed the leader, but also you become the means of exploitation. The leader depends upon you and you depend upon him, and since you are in confusion and in sorrow, what you bring forth, the leader, must be inevitably confused and miserable. This desire to follow is a form of self-fulfillment; you fulfill yourself in a leader and in turn he fulfills himself in you. This mutual self-fulfillment and exploitation can lead nowhere. When there is self-fulfillment through an organization, political or religious, through painting, through writing, through any other activity, it must lead to frustration. Being unconsciously aware of this aching failure, you go from one leader to another, from one guru to another. So the leader becomes very important; he is ever the leader and you are ever the follower.</p>
<p>Self-fulfillment leads to misery and is one of the causes of confusion and degradation. As I am not seeking self-fulfillment in the name of God or country, of peace or belief, and not in any way depending psychologically upon another, I cannot possibly become your leader. It does not matter to me whether there is one or many or none to listen to what I teach, and so there is no mutual exploitation. The greed for power and position leads to exploitation, to intrigues and indignities. So neither am I your leader, your guru, nor are you going to make me one, another among your varied collection. I do not want to lead for the very simple reason that reality is not to be understood by following another. Reality comes into being only when the desire for self-fulfillment, in any form whatsoever, has wholly ceased. When there is freedom from psychological demands, conscious or unconscious, when thought is free from the pursuing desire, then there is reality. Reality alone can bring peace and happiness.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is the difference between belief and confidence? Why do you condemn belief?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: What do we mean by belief? Why do we have to have belief? Belief implies acceptance, trust, faith in something inward or outward. Belief gives assurance, confidence, a sense of security, and the more that you believe in something, the greater the security. To be psychologically without a belief is very disturbing, is it not? Fear and belief ever go together; they are inseparable, they are the two sides of a coin. Belief comes into being when the mind is seeking security, certainty; it creates belief as a means of self-protection or takes on the belief of others; or it projects its hopes and fears into the future, into time, making them as the ideal, and disciplines itself according to its projections in order to achieve security, a refuge where there is no disturbance of any kind. This factor, the desire for security, for refuge, breeds different forms of beliefs according to environmental and psychological influences. You believe in God, another does not; you are a Hindu or a Muslim, a Christian or a nonbeliever, and so on. Thus, belief divides, setting man against man. The desire to be psychologically secure creates divisions, as mine and yours, and thus gives vast significance to secondary values, to sensory values.</p>
<p>See what belief has done to man and so to the world. Politically or religiously, man is torn apart; the belief in many contending schemes and blueprints is causing conflict and enmity; organized religious beliefs in the name of God and peace are setting man against man; man is destroying man because of his belief in his country, in his security, in his God. Belief invariably breeds more belief, more conflict, more confusion, more antagonism. Belief is the result of the hidden demands of self-fulfillment. Happiness is sought through self-fulfillment, which is through belief, and there is no happiness in things made by the hand or by the mind. If you seek happiness through something, then the thing becomes all-important and not happiness.</p>
<p>What do we mean by confidence? Trust or faith in something. Assurance or confidence gives a certain trust in oneself, as practice on an instrument gives. From this continued and sustained assurance there is a kind of self-aggression. Confidence in the self is another form of self-fulfillment.</p>
<p>Now, there is another kind of confidence which comes through self-knowledge. I am using confidence for the lack of a better word. To be aware of every thought and feeling and to follow them through completely brings joy; in understanding the many layers of consciousness - the superficial and the hidden - there is freedom whose joy is wholly different from the self-expanding assurance. When there is an understanding of the poison of the hindrances, then there is freedom; when the activities of the self are explored and understood, then there is imperishable ecstasy. This exploration is not based on any belief, on any formulation of the mind. Discovery based on belief ceases to be the true; experience based on belief is the self-projected continuation, and so experience is ever binding. When the mind is aware, its cunning tricks are known, then it knows itself as its own creator. Then, when it ceases to create, there is creation.</p>
