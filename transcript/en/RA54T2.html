<p>I would like to talk this morning on a topic which may be rather difficult, but we will try and make it as simple and direct as possible. You know most of us have some kind of fear, have we not? Do you know your particular fear? You may be afraid of your teacher, of your guardian, of your parents, of the older people, or of a snake or a buffalo or of what somebody says or of death, and so on. Each one has fear, but for young people, the fears are fairly simple. As we grow older the fears become more complex, more difficult, more subtle. I want to fulfill myself in a particular direction. You know what ''fulfillment'' means? I want to become a great writer. I feel if I could write, my life would be happy. So, I want to write. But anything may happen to me, I may get paralyzed for the rest of my life, and that becomes my fear. So, as we grow older, various forms of fear come into being - fears of being left alone, not having a friend, losing property, having no position, and various other types of fear. But we won't go now into the very difficult and subtle types of fear because they require much more thought.</p>
<p>It is very important that we - you young people and I - should consider this question of fear because society and the older people think fear is necessary to keep you in right behavior. If you are afraid of your teacher or of your parents, they can control you better, can they not? They can say, ''Do this and do not do that,'' and you will jolly well have to obey them. So fear is used as a moral pressure. The teachers use fear, say, in a large class, as a means of controlling the students. Is it not so? Society says fear is necessary. Otherwise, the citizens, the people, will just burst out and do things wildly. Fear has thus become a necessity for the control of man.</p>
<p>You know, fear is also used to civilize man. Religions throughout the world have used fear as a means of controlling man, have they not? They say that if you do not do certain things in this life, you will pay for it in the next. Though all religions preach love, though they preach brotherhood, though they talk about the unity of man, they all subtly or very brutally, grossly, maintain this sense of fear.</p>
<p>If you have a large number of students in one class, how can the teacher control you? He cannot. He has to invent ways and means of controlling you. So, he says, ''Compete. Become like that other boy who is much cleverer that you.'' So, you struggle, you are afraid; your fear is generally used as a means of controlling you. Do you understand? Is it not very important that education should eradicate fear, should help the students to get rid of fear, because fear corrupts the mind? I think it is very important in a school of this kind that every form of fear should be understood and dispelled, got rid of. Otherwise, if you have any kind of fear, it twists your mind, and you can never be intelligent. Fear is like a dark cloud, and when you have fear, it is like walking in sunshine with a dark cloud in your mind, always frightened.</p>
<p>So, is not the function of true education to help you to understand fear and be free of it? For instance, suppose you go off without telling your housemaster or teacher, and you come back and invent stories, saying that you have been with some people, while you have been to a cinema - it means that really you are frightened, does it not? You may think that if you are not frightened of the teacher, you will do what you like, and the teachers think the same. But to understand fear implies a great deal more than doing exactly what you want to do. You know, there are natural reactions of the body, are there not? When you see a snake, you jump. That is not fear because that is the natural reaction of the body. In front of danger, the body reacts, it jumps. When you see a precipice, you do not just walk blindly along. That is not fear. When you see danger, a car coming very fast, you get out of the way. It is not an indication of fear. Those are the body's responses to protect itself against danger; such reactions are not fear.</p>
<p>Fear comes in, does it not, when you want to do something and you are prevented from doing it. That is one type of fear. You want to go to a cinema, you would like to go out of Banaras for the day, and the teacher says, ''No, there are regulations.'' And you do not like these regulations, you want to go. So you go an some excuse. The teacher finds out that you have gone, and you are afraid of punishment. So, fear comes in when there is a feeling that you are going to be punished. But if the teacher talks over quietly why you should not go to town, explains to you the dangers, eating food which is not clean, and so on, you understand. Even if he has not the time to explain to you and go into the whole problem of why you should not go, you also can think, your intelligence can be awakened to find out why you should not go. Then, there is no problem, you do not go. If you want to go, you talk it over and find out.</p>
<p>To do just what you like in order to show that you are free from fear is not intelligence. Courage is not the opposite of fear. You know, in the battlefields they are very courageous. For various reasons they take drinks or do all kinds of things to feel courageous, but that is not freedom from fear.</p>
<p>Should not education help the student to be free from fear of every kind? - which means from now on to understand all the problems of life, problems of sex, problems of death, of public opinion, of authority. We are going to discuss all these things so that when you leave this place, though there are fears in the world, though you have your own ambitions, your own desires, you will understand them, and so be free from fear. Because, you know, fear is very dangerous. All people are afraid of something or other. Most people do not want to make a mistake, do not want to go wrong, especially when they are young. So they think that if they could follow somebody, if they could listen to somebody, they would be told what to do, and by doing that, they would achieve an end, a purpose.</p>
<p>Most of us are very conservative. You know what that word means, you know what it is ''to conserve''? - to hold, to guard. Most of us want to remain respectable, and so we want to do the right thing, we want to follow the right conduct - which you will see, if you go into it very deeply, is an indication of fear. Why not make a mistake? Why not find out? But the man who is afraid is always thinking, ''I must do the right thing, I must look respectable, I must not let the public know what I really am.'' Such a man is fundamentally, basically, afraid. A man who is ambitious is really a frightened person, and a man who is frightened has no love, has no sympathy. He is like a person imprisoned behind a wall. It is very important, while we are young, to understand this thing, to understand fear. It is fear that makes me obey, but if we can talk it over, reason together, discuss and think together, then I may understand and do what I am asked. But to compel me, to force me to do a thing which I do not understand because I am frightened of you, is wrong education, is it not?</p>
<p>So, I feel it is very important in a place like this that both the educator and the educated should understand this problem. Creativity, to be creative - do you know what it means? To write a poem is partly creative, to paint a picture, to look at a tree, to love the tree, the river, the birds, the people, the earth, to have the feeling that the earth is ours - that is partly creative. But that feeling is destroyed when you have fear, when you say, ''This is mine - my country, my class, my group, my philosophy, my religion.'' When you have that kind of feeling, you are not creative because it is the instinct of fear that is dictating this feeling of ''mine,'' ''my country.'' After all, the earth is not yours or mine - it is ours. And if we can think in those terms, we will create quite a different world - not an American world or a Russian world or an Indian world, but it will be our world, yours and mine, the rich man's and the poor man's. But the difficulty is, when there is fear we cannot create. A person who is afraid can never find truth or God. Behind all our worship, all our images, all our rituals, there is fear, and therefore your gods are not gods, they are stones.</p>
<p>So, it is very important while we are young to understand this thing, and you can only understand it when you know that you are afraid, when you can look at your own fears. But that requires a great deal of insight, which we won't discuss now. Because it is a much deeper problem which the older people can discuss - so we will discuss that with the teachers. But it is the function of the educator to help the educated to understand fear. It is for the teachers to help you to understand your fears and not to suppress them, not to hold them down, so that when you leave this place, your mind is very clear, sharp, unspoiled by fear. As I was saying yesterday, the old people have not created a beautiful world; they are full of darkness, fear, corruption, competition; they have not created a good world. If you, going out of this place, can really be free from fear of every kind or understand how to meet fear in yourself and in others, then perhaps you will create quite a different world, not a world of the communist, or of the congressite, and so on, but a totally different world; truly that is the function of education.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is sorrow?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: A boy of ten asks what is sorrow! Do you know anything of sorrow? Do not bother who is asking. But a little boy asking what is sorrow is a sad thing, is it not, it is a very terrible thing. Why should he know sorrow? It is the old people, unfortunately, who know sorrow. But do you know what sorrow means? When you see a beggar and a rich man going by, when you see death, a body being burned, when you see a dead bird, when you see somebody crying, when you see degradation, poverty, people quarreling, hitting each other verbally and physically, all that is sorrow, is it not? When your father or mother dies, you are left alone, and you have sorrow. But here we grow with death. You understand what I am saying, that we grow with death? We are never happy human beings. You see a dead body being carried to the river, and if you are with your parents, they say, ''Do not look, death is terrible.'' So it begins. When you see a beggar - even as a little boy you cannot help seeing a beggar - with torn clothes, disease, wounds on his body, you feel so sorry for that man, but your parents or the older people take you away without explaining. It is a calamity, a social misery that there are such people. The parents are responsible because they do not explain all these things; they want to protect you, hide you from all that. They do not want to make you a revolutionary - which does not mean becoming a silly communist; a revolutionary is someone very, very different. They do not explain to you all these things. They are frightened, and they want to protect you.</p>
<p>Sorrow is something that has to be understood, tears have to be understood. There is no need for understanding when you are happy. When you smile, that does not need an explanation! But you see we are brought up, here as well as outside, unfortunately, without knowing how to think, how to observe, how to watch, and so we increase sorrow and multiply our trouble. But if, in our education, our teachers can point out these things, discuss, talk them over, then we may not be just the ordinary, everyday, stupid fathers or mothers or politicians or clerks but real human beings who are truly revolutionary and out to create a new world. Then perhaps we can understand, change, and put away sorrow.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is the definition of the good world?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: You know, as I said yesterday, this meeting is primarily meant for students who want to find out, who want to discuss. The older people, if they are interested to help the students, would do well not to ask questions about their own personal problems. Probably children are not interested in the definition of the ''good world.''</p>
<p>Now, why does the mind ask such a question? ''What is the definition of a good world?'' The statement is clear; you can look it up in a dictionary and there you will find a definition. We think that by finding a definition we have understood the problem. That is how we are trained; we think we understand when we have a definition. But definition is not understanding; on the contrary, it is the most destructive way of thinking. Why do you want to know the definition of the good world? Because you cannot think out the problem, you go to somebody - to Shankara, to Buddha, to me, or to someone else - and say, ''Please tell me the meaning of the good world.'' If you can think it out, go into it, understand it, then perhaps you will have real enlightenment.</p>
<p>What do we mean by ''good world''? It is really very important to go into this. The word has a meaning, has it not, it has a reference. A word like God or love or sacrifice, or a word like India has great significance. Because you think you believe in God, the word God has a meaning to you; nervously you react to that word; psychologically you respond to it. If you do not believe in God, that word is nonsense to you. If I have been trained in atheism or communism, in which I do not believe in God, then I react differently. Similarly, to you, good world might mean something, but to me it might have no meaning.</p>
<p>What do you mean by ''good world''? There is no good world. The fact is the world is rotten because there are wars, there are divisions of people - the higher and the lower, the authority, the prime minister and the poor cook, the big politician and the starving man, the king who has got everything and the other fellow who has nothing. It is a rotten world. We are caught by the words good and world. We have to understand what that word good implies, and we have to create a world which is good.</p>
<p>It is no good being carried away by words. We are always taught from childhood what to think, but never how to think. There is a science called semantics; in Greek, it means the meaning of words. There is a whole science of words being developed now. Words affect us mentally as well as physically, and it is very important to understand them and not be affected by them. The moment the word communism is used, a capitalist goes into a shiver about it. Similarly, a man who has property is scared of the word revolution; if you talk about revolution, he will throw you out. If you say to those who follow a guru, ''Don't follow another, it is silly to follow,'' they also get scared and want to throw you out. This constant fear of words is due to lack of understanding. After all, education is the understanding of words and the understanding of communication through words.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a ''good world.'' We must take things as they are and not idealize; we must not have ideals as to what the world should be. All ideals - the ideal school, the ideal country, the ideal headmaster, the ideal of nonviolence - are nonsense, they are ridiculous, they are all illusions. What is real is actually what is. If I can understand the actual thing as it is - the poverty, the degradation, the squalor, the ambition, the greediness, the corruption, fears - then I can deal with it, I can break it down. But if I say, ''I should be this or that,'' then I wander off into illusion. This country has been fed for centuries on ideals which are all illusion. You have been fed on nonviolence when you are really violent. Why not understand violence, and not talk of nonviolence? If you have understanding of what is, there would be a real revolution.</p>
<p>Questioner: Can you tell me how to get rid of fear?</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: You want to know how to get rid of fear? Do you know what you are afraid of? Go slowly with me. Fear is something which exists in relation to something else, it does not exist by itself. It exists in relation to a snake, to what my parents or teacher might say, to death; it is in connection with something. Do you understand? Fear is not a thing by itself, it exists in contact, in relation, in touch with something else. Are you conscious, aware that you are afraid in relation to something else? Are you not afraid of your parents, are you not afraid of your teachers? I hope not, but probably you are. Are you not afraid that you may not pass your examinations? Are you not afraid that people may not think of you nicely and decently and say what a great man you are? Don't you know your own fears? I am trying to show how you have fear, and you have lost interest already.</p>
<p>So, first you must know what you are afraid of. I will explain to you very slowly. Then you must know also, the mind must know why it is afraid. Is fear something apart from the mind? Does not the mind itself create fear, either because it remembers the past or it projects itself into the future? You had better pester your teachers until they explain to you all these things. You spend an hour every day over mathematics or geography, but you do not spend even two minutes over the most important problems of life. Should you not spend much more time with your teachers over this - how to be free from fear - instead of merely discussing mathematics or reading a textbook? You have asked this question, how to get rid of fear, but your mind is not capable of following it. The older people perhaps can. So, we are going to discuss this later with the teachers.</p>
<p>A school based on fear of any kind is a rotten school, it should not exist. It requires a great deal of intelligence on the part of the teachers and of the boys to understand this problem. Fear corrupts, and to be free from fear, one has to understand how the mind creates fear. There is no such thing as fear except what the mind itself creates. The mind wants shelter, the mind wants security, the mind has various forms of self-protective ambition; and as long as all that exists, you will have fear. It is very important to understand ambition, to understand authority; both are indications of this fear which is so destructive.</p>
<p>Questioner: It is true, as you said, that fear corrupts the mined, especially with old people. It is also true that corrupt minds, especially of the older people, create fear. The problem appears to be how to eliminate such minds.</p>
<p>KRISHNAMURTI: You have understood the question? The gentleman says, ''Should we not eliminate the older minds which are corrupted by fear?'' This means what? Destroy the older people, put them into concentration camps? All minds, whether old or young, are corrupted by fear, either imposed from outside or self-created. It is not a question of getting rid of somebody. That is what they are doing all over the world - if I do not agree with you, you liquidate me, you put me in a concentration camp. That is not going to solve the problem. What is going to solve the problem is the right kind of education which will help me to understand the problem of fear - how fear comes into being, how it comes from the past and is also created in the present and projected into the future.</p>
<p>Sirs, do think about this; this is far more important than all your examinations, your textbooks, your degrees; B.A. or M.A. after your name means absolutely nothing, though it may get you a job. The problem is not how to liquidate the old people or the young people with corrupt minds. What is wanted now is an inward revolution, a mind capable of thinking of all these problems differently and creating a new world.</p>
