<p>Most of us have many problems and many anxieties, conflicts, and strife, for which we are not able to find a lasting solution. We do not see the problem clearly and precisely. We do not read the intricacies and the implications of the problem deeply and simply. The problem is blurred by the many screens that we have created within it and ourselves. Whatever the problem - economic or social, superficial or psychological - we have conclusions and ready-made answers for them. We approach them either with apprehension or with preconceived formulations. These prevent the deep and lasting understanding of the problem, for the answer is not away from the problem but in the problem itself. Our whole difficulty, then, is to view the problem clearly and simply, because the problem is never the same, it is never still, it is ever undergoing a change. To understand a problem we must understand the creator of the problem, which is the mind, the self, the 'me'.</p>
<p>We are sufficiently content with things either produced by the machine, by the hand, or by the mind, by thought, by belief. The things made by the hand or by the mind are both sensate. The things made by the hand soon wear out and so do things produced by the mind. The evaluations of the mind are soon established, fixed in a framework of references, but this standardization cannot be permanent.</p>
<p>So, there is constant strife between the search for permanency and the things that soon wear out and pass away. The things produced by the hand are misused by the mind. Food, clothing, and shelter are given wrong values by the mind. It is the false psychological valuations of things made by the mind that breed conflict and misery. So, in the misuse lies our misery. So, the mind with its will and its capacity for valuation, which is the intellect, must be understood.</p>
<p>As long as will, which is the expression of desire, and the capacity for evaluation, which is the outcome of craving, are not clearly and wholly understood and their subtlety and significance are not perceived, there will be conflict and misery. This understanding of the ways of desire with its will and evaluation, with its choice and justification, with its identification and denial, is self-knowledge. Self-knowledge makes straight that which is crooked. Self-knowledge makes straight that which is corrupt. So long as there is no self-knowledge but the process of the mind, there must be the wrong valuation, which inevitably breeds confusion and antagonism.</p>
<p>Self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom, and without understanding there is no happiness. Thus, the awareness of what is - however complex a problem may appear - without distorting it, is the dissolution of the problem. To see the problem deeply and swiftly is not possible without self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Without meditation there can be no self-knowledge. Meditation is a process of perceiving the truth of every thought, feeling, and so action. Meditation is not the exclusion of all thoughts and the fixation on a particular object, image, or idea. It is a constant awareness of every thought and feeling as it arises without choice, condemnation, or justification. It is the perception of truth in the problem that frees thought from the problem. With the unfolding of self-knowledge, the sorrow that comes with wrong valuations of things, of people, and of ideas fades away. This knowledge is not of the higher or lower self, which is still within the field of the mind - which is a false and self-protected division without any reality. This knowledge is the total process of one's own being.</p>
<p>So, as long as there is no self-knowledge, the multiplication and reformation of our problems will continue. For this reason only, the individual becomes greatly significant. He can alone transform himself. He alone can bring about revolution in his relationship, the necessary regeneration in the world of his relationship. This transformation can only come about through the knowledge of the self; it cannot come about through book knowledge, through inference, through another, however great. This knowledge is not in antagonism to the world about us. It is not a process of self-isolation. He cannot be without relationship. The understanding of this relationship to things, to people, and to ideas will alone bring happiness. Happiness comes not with the evaluation, not with the choice; it comes when the chooser, the actor, the mind, is not occupied with himself. When the mind is silent, truth and bliss come into being. Such a man is blessed.</p>
<p>Questioner: Why don't you do miracles? All teachers did.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: To be healed physically is not so important as to be healed psychologically. In the past, I have healed physically. Now I am concerned with the healing of the inner, which is far more important, is it not? If the mind and the heart are diseased, they affect the body, which in turn affects the mind. If we give too much importance to the outer and neglect the inner, the inner will always overcome the outer.</p>
<p>This desire for the miracle, this transformation of the inner, is what you are looking for. You want a miracle to happen, which is really a sign of laziness, of irresponsibility. You want somebody else to do the job for you. The healing of the outer may make for popularity, but that will not lead man to happiness. So, we should understand the inward emptiness, the inward disease and corruption. None can heal you inwardly and that is the miracle of it. A doctor can heal you outwardly; a psychoanalyst may make you normal to fit into a decaying society; but to go beyond, to be inwardly true, clear, uncorrupted - that you alone can do and none else. This is the greatest miracle: to heal yourself completely.</p>
<p>This is what we have been doing here during the last three months - to understand ourselves, the causes of our disease, conflict, and contradiction; to see things as they are, clearly and simply, without distortion. When a thing is seen clearly, then a miracle takes place; then, that which is is perceived without distortion, and the truth that understanding brings, heals. The truth of that understanding can come only through your own awareness and not through a miracle performed by another. Miracles do happen, but only we are unaware of it. You are not the same as you were yesterday. If you can follow the inward nature of the mind easily and swiftly, then you will see that miracles will happen, the miracles of newness, of life, of beauty, and of happiness. But you cannot follow the swift movement of life if you are tethered, bound to your own achievements and belief. A man who knows, who is caught in what he knows - there can be no miracle for him. But a man who is uncertain, who asks nothing - to him life is a miracle, for there is constant renewal, a renewal without an end.</p>
<p>Questioner: You have said that some transformation has taken place in all your listeners; presumably, they have to wait for its manifestation. How then can you call it immediate?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: As long as you are looking for transformation, a result to be gained, there will be no transformation. As long as you are thinking in terms of achievement, in terms of time, there can be no transformation, for then the mind is caught in the net of time. When you say you are thinking in terms of immediate transformation, you are thinking of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Such transformation within time is merely change, which is modified continuity. When thought is free of time, there will be a timeless transformation.</p>
<p>As long as a problem is thought about, the problem will continue. Thought creates the problem. That which is the result of the past, the mind, cannot solve the problem. The mind can analyze, can examine, but it cannot resolve the problem. The problem, however complex and however close, ceases only when the thought process comes to an end. When the mind - which is the result of many yesterdays, with its reasons and calculations - ceases, then only the problem comes to an end. That which is the result of time cannot bring about transformation; it can and will bring about a change, which is modified continuity or rearrangement of a pattern, but such action does not bring about freedom.</p>
<p>What do we mean by transformation? Surely, the cessation of all problems, cessation from conflict, confusion, and misery. If you observe, you will see that the mind is cultivating, sowing, and harvesting as a farmer cultivates, sows, and reaps. But, unlike the farmer who allows the field to lie fallow during winter, the mind never allows itself to lie fallow. As the rains, the storms, and the sunshine recreate the earth, so during that passive yet alert fallowness of the mind, there is rejuvenation, a renewal. So the mind renews itself and the problems are resolved. The problems are resolved only when they are seen clearly and swiftly.</p>
<p>The mind is constantly distracted, escaping, because to see a problem clearly might lead to action which might create further disturbance; and so the mind is constantly avoiding facing the problem, which only gives strength to the problem. But, when it is seen clearly without distortion, then it ceases to be. So long as you think in terms of transformation, there cannot be transformation, now or hereafter. Transformation can come only when every problem is immediately understood. You can understand it when there is no choice and the seeking of a result, when there is no condemnation or justification. Where there is love, there is neither choice nor search for an end, nor condemnation, nor justification. It is this love that brings about transformation.</p>
<p>Questioner: What are the foundations of right livelihood? How can I find out whether any livelihood is right? How can I find a right livelihood in a basically wrong society?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: In a basically wrong society, there cannot be a right means of livelihood. Such a livelihood will inevitably contribute to general misery and destruction. This society is founded upon envy, ill will, on acquisitiveness, and on the desire for power. Such a society will breed soldiers, police force, and lawyers. These products of such a disintegrating society inevitably bring further division, further strife, and further pain. These disintegrating factors also breed the big businessman and the politician with his party politics and ideologies.</p>
<p>So, all this has to be transformed to form a right society in which there can be right livelihood. Such a revolution is not an impossible task. You and I have to do it. It can be brought about only when you and I are not envious and seeking power, are not antagonistic and acquisitive. Then we will be able to create a new society; then we will find a right livelihood even in a disintegrating society; then we will be able to create a new society in which man is not held by its static demands, and in which there will be those who will not ask reward for their actions, those who have no authority or power over another. They are inwardly rich, for truth has come to them. It is only the man that seeks reality who can create a new social order. Only love can bring about transformation in the world of corruption.</p>
<p>Questioner: How can a man who never left the limits of his mind go beyond his mind to experience direct communion with truth?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: When you know the limits of your mind, are you not already beyond it? To be aware of your limits - surely it is the first step, which in itself is difficult, for the limits of the mind are enormous. To be aware of a limitation without condemnation is to be free of that limitation. To be aware of a prejudice, a limitation, without choice, condemnation, or justification is to be free of that prejudice. There cannot be experience of direct communion with truth if the mind does not know its limitations. The awareness of limitation is the beginning of self-knowledge. Self-knowledge is not a goal. Self-knowledge is the experience and discovery of oneself from moment to moment, the discovery of truth from moment to moment. Truth is not continuous and is not bound from moment to moment. 'You', the limitation, can never be unified with truth. 'You' can never find truth. 'You' must cease for truth to be. 'You' are the limitation. So, you must understand the extent of your limitation and be passively aware of it. Then, into that passivity, truth comes into being.</p>
<p>Darkness cannot be unified with light; ignorance cannot become wisdom. Ignorance and darkness must cease for wisdom and light to come into being. Wisdom has no ultimate end. It comes into being when ignorance from moment to moment is experienced, discovered, and dissolved.</p>
<p>Questioner: Attachment is the stuff of which we are made. How can we be free from attachment?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Surely, attachment is not a problem, is it? Why do you want to be detached, and why are you attached? Why have you this constant strife of attachment and detachment? Why are you attached? What would happen if you were not attached?</p>
<p>Without attachment you would be lost, you would be empty. Without property, without name, you are as nothing. Without your bank account, if you have one, without your beliefs, what are you? You are an empty shell, are you not? So, afraid of being nothing, you are attached to something. Attachment brings with it many problems of fear, of frustrations, of cruelty. Being caught in the net of suffering that attachment brings, you try to become detached, then you try to renounce your property, your family, your ideas; but you have not really solved the problem, which is the fear of being nothing. Strip yourself of your titles, of your capacities, of your jewels, and all the rest of it, what are you?</p>
<p>Knowing inwardly that there is a void, an emptiness, a nothingness, and being afraid of it, you depend, you are attached, and you possess. In possession, in attachment, there is cruelty. In the possession of another, you are not concerned with that other, but only with yourself, and this you call love. So, why do you not accept that which is? That which is, which is nothing. Not that you should become nothing, but that you are actually nothing.</p>
<p>This recognition of what is frees the mind of all its renunciation, from attachment and from detachment. Then only is there beauty, a richness, and a blessing which cannot be understood by a man who is afraid of what is. But, to a man who is afraid of this emptiness, life is a struggle and a pain; then he is caught in the conflict of endless opposites. A man who is nothing knows love, for love is nothing.</p>
<p>Questioner: Is extensional awareness the same as creative emptiness? Is not awareness passive and therefore not creative? Is not the process of self-awareness tedious and painful?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: If awareness is practiced, made into a habit, then it becomes tedious and painful. Awareness cannot be disciplined. That which is practiced is no longer awareness, for in practice is implied the creation of habit, the exertion of effort and will. Effort is distortion. There is not only the awareness of the outer - of the flight of birds, of shadows, of the restless sea, the trees and the wind, the beggar and the luxurious cars that pass by - but also there is the awareness of the psychological process, the inward tension and conflict. You do not condemn a bird in flight; you observe it, you see the beauty of it. But, when you consider your own inward strife, you condemn it or justify it. You are incapable of observing this inward conflict without choice or justification.</p>
<p>To be aware of your thought and feeling without identification and denial is not tedious and painful, but in search of a result, an end to be gained, conflict is increased and the tedium of strife begins. In awareness there is no becoming, there is no end to be gained. There is silent observation without choice and condemnation, from which there comes understanding. In this process when thought and feeling unfold themselves - which is only possible when there is neither acquisition nor acceptance - then there comes an extensional awareness. In this extensional awareness, all the hidden layers and their significance are revealed. This awareness reveals that creative emptiness which cannot be imagined or formulated. This extensional awareness and the creative emptiness are total process and are not different stages.</p>
<p>When you silently observe a problem without condemnation or justification, there comes passive awareness. In this passive awareness, the problem is understood and dissolved. In awareness there is heightened sensitivity, in which there is the highest form of negative thinking. When the mind is formulating, producing, there can be no creation. It is only when the mind is still and empty, when it is not creating a problem - in that alert passivity there is creation. Creation can only take place in negation, which is not the opposite of the positive. Being nothing is not the antithesis of being something. A problem comes into being only when there is a search for result. When the search for result ceases, then only is there no problem.</p>
<p>Questioner: What do you mean by love?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Love is the unknowable. It can be realized only when the known is understood and transcended. Only when the mind is free of the known, then only there will be love. So, we must approach love negatively and not positively.</p>
<p>What is love to most of us? With us, when we love, in it there is possessiveness, dominance, or subservience. From this possession arises jealousy and fear of loss, and we legalize this possessive instinct. From possessiveness there arises jealousy and the innumerable conflicts with which each one is familiar. Possessiveness, then, is not love. Nor is it sentimental. To be sentimental, to be emotional, excludes love. Sensitivity and emotions are merely sensations. A so-called religious person, who weeps over the object of his adoration, is indulging in sensation. Sensation and emotion are the process of thought, and thought is not love. Sentimentality as emotion is a form of self-expansion. Emotions are cruel; in them are like and dislike. An emotional person can be stirred to hatred and to war.</p>
<p>Mercy and pity, forgiveness and respect are not emotions. There is love when sentimentality and emotion and devotion cease. Devotion is not love; devotion is a form of self-expansion. Respect is not for the few, but for man, whether he is low or high. Generosity and mercy have no reward.</p>
<p>Love alone can transform insanity, confusion, and strife. No system, no theory of the left or of the right can bring peace and happiness to man. Where there is love, there is no possessiveness, no envy; there is mercy and compassion, not in theory, but actually to your wife and to your children, to your neighbor and to your servant. When you are respectful to your servant as well as to your guru, then you will know love. Love alone can transform the world. Love alone can bring about mercy and beauty, order and peace. There is love with its blessing when 'you' cease to be.</p>
<p>Questioner: May we request you to state clearly whether there is God or not?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Why do you seek my confirmation? Either I will strengthen you in your belief or shake you away from it. If I confirm, you will be pleased and you will go on with your rough and ugly ways. If I disturb you, you will soon cover up that disturbance and carry on with your daily routine. But why do you want to know? This is far more important - to find out why you want to know - than if there is or if there is not God. To know reality, to know God, you must not seek Him. If you seek, you are escaping from what is. You want to escape from suffering to an illusion which you call God. Your books are full of God. The temples, with their images, do not hold God.</p>
<p>For reality to come into being, suffering must cease, and the mere search for truth, for God, for immortality, is an escape from suffering. It is more pleasant to discuss whether there is or there is not God than to dissolve the causes of suffering. He who discusses the nature of God can never know God. Reality cannot be caught in a garland of words. You cannot catch the wind in a fist. You cannot capture reality in a temple nor in ceremonies.</p>
<p>All escapes are on the same level, whether the escape is through the temple or through a drink. The search for God may not be so harmful to society as the escape through acquisitiveness, but this search for God cannot bring about the realization of God. Until you understand and transcend suffering, reality cannot come into being. So, your inquiry whether there is or there is not God is vain: it has no meaning. Your inquiry can but lead to illusion. How can the mind that is caught in the turmoil of daily greed and suffering, in ignorance and envy, know that which is illimitable, unutterable? How can the mind which is the product of time know the timeless? It cannot. So, to think about truth, about God, is another form of escape. Thought is the result of time, the product of memory. So, how can thought find that which is timeless, eternal? It cannot.</p>
<p>When the thought process comes to an end - which is to understand suffering and not escape from it - suffering, which is not only on the superficial level but at different levels of consciousness, is transcended. This means we must be open, vulnerable to suffering. You are suffering, with an occasional ray of sunshine.</p>
<p>Since you suffer, why not understand it thoroughly and resolve it finally? This cessation of sorrow is not so difficult. For a mind that is caught in the net of suffering, it is more difficult to search out God, for He is the unknown and you cannot search for the unknown. But you can be aware of suffering, and in this awareness the cause of it is known. Since you run away from sorrow through many forms of escape, be aware of these escapes, and come directly, actually, face to face with suffering. Only then can sorrow come to an end. Then the mind is tranquil. This tranquillity is not a result; it is not the product of a disciplined, controlled mind. As the lake is still when the breezes stop, so the mind is still. Such a mind is a blessing, for it is then capable of receiving the highest. The experiencing of reality is not an illusion, but the experience which comes through an escape which you call God is an illusion.</p>
<p>So, to seek God is not to find Him, but to understand suffering and for the mind to free itself from its own self-created problems brings tranquillity. Then only, reality can come into being.</p>
