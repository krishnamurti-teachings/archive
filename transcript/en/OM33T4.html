<p>You know, life is a tremendous mystery and most of us create a false mystery, an illusion, and try to penetrate that illusion, hoping that it will be real. We prefer the mystery of an illusion to the mystery of reality, and life is a mystery which cannot be understood if mind and heart are caught up in an illusion. So, all illusion must cease before one can penetrate that innermost sanctuary that one calls life. I am trying to show the manner it can be penetrated, not the way, because I do not believe there is such a thing as a way. There is no path to truth. It is an uncharted land. It is an uncharted land, and you must come to it entirely naked, unprepared; you cannot have it charted, laid down; you must come to it wholly, unprepared, free, naked. Then you will understand it.</p>
<p>Now, to me, there is a living ecstasy which may be called God, reality, that is a timeless becoming. It is not an end which is to be gained, achieved, or conquered. It is a thing that is continually moving, changing, alive; it cannot be described. To discover it, to understand it, to penetrate it, the mind must be free of this idea of achievement. You cannot think of truth in terms of gains or in terms of success or conquering. Please, this is not rhetorical. Don’t listen to me with a rhetorical mind. And as most minds are crippled by this idea of conquering, achieving, catching hold, our whole system of thought is based on it.</p>
<p>To understand that living reality, the mind must be wholly free of this idea of achievement, because achievement involves time; that which you are going to gain implies a future and a present and a past. A mind and a heart that is caught up in time cannot understand that endless becoming. So achievement, gain, conquering and success, truth as a reward for righteous action, implies an effort, indicates that you must make a tremendous volition, develop a will, character, in order to attain, in order to be rewarded for your effort. And where there is an effort there is a duality: the thing which you conquer and the conqueror. Where there is duality there is an opposite, an antithesis, as good and bad, pain and pleasure, reward and punishment. As long as there is duality in mind there is effort to escape from one to the other. This effort gives birth to the consciousness of the ‘I’, self-consciousness, and hence there arises suffering, pain, and the idea of time broken up into past, present, and future. Where mind is continually seeking advancement, achievement, success, conquering a virtue or an end, there is the implication of duality, which creates a consciousness of the ‘I’. From that there arises suffering. So to overcome the suffering, we resort to forgetfulness, because most people are caught up in suffering. With that suffering, with that continual uncertainty and lack of comprehension, which created a void, an emptiness, we are all the time trying to forget it, to run away from it or trying to conquer it through self-discipline. This forgetfulness, this running away or disciplining oneself, further increases that duality and then there is that strain of conquest, and the battle takes place. This is a process each one goes through consciously or unconsciously. The result is that you have set up an end to be conquered, which you consider to be true, an ideal of perfection, of God, of truth, of life; and you are always straining to discipline yourself to conquer it, to train your mind to dwell constantly on that idea and to function in it. So you create in your mind a duality, an observer, a controller, and the thing which is observed and controlled. So you develop a higher mind and a lower mind, a higher emotion and a lower emotion, because your mind is suffocated, gripped in this duality.</p>
<p>Hence, naturally there is continual disharmony which creates conflict, and you are caught up in this circle. That is what is happening; that is obvious. That is what is taking place in each one: this establishment of an idea, which we call truth or God - which is impossible because you cannot understand it, you cannot picture it as a whole until you are completely free of it. You can have an occasional glimpse, but if you cling to that glimpse, you are destroying the full comprehension of the present. So we begin to establish what we consider truth, which is born out of prejudice, because we always choose that which we consider to be truth out of like and dislike, what gives you satisfaction, mentally, emotionally, or any other way. So you distinguish between right action and wrong action - the right action being dominated by the higher mind, the mind that is continually observing, conquering, guiding, and, hence, creates in itself a duality, the ‘I’ and the non ‘I’. This is not another philosophy. It is what happens with each of us. That is how the process of self-discipline takes place.</p>
<p>Now, to me, this is entirely erroneous. The whole process of approach is entirely wrong, because it indicates a ceaseless effort, and as I say, where there is effort there is no understanding of truth. Truth does not come through effort. It must be born naturally when you remove all hindrances, when you are free from all barriers created by effort. What creates this duality in us? Action. Action born out of the desire for want, gain; action born out of fear, punishment - that creates a duality. And, as I say, it is only action itself which is life, which is eternal. So when the mind is caught up by the bondage of a reward, or a punishment, or a motive, or the search after truth, action has lost its significance, and instead of action there is always the sense of achievement as opposed to action. To me, action is infinite, everlasting, enduring; whereas achievement has a finality. So it is only when the mind and heart are free from all hindrances that life can flow easily, spontaneously, naturally, frankly. It is like a twisted ankle, which causes pain, and when the ankle is put back in its place, life flows naturally again through it. So in the same way, when you free the mind from all hindrances, from all barriers, then life flows through it easily. That is eternal action, but these hindrances are not to be conquered. You cannot say, I am going to conquer my hindrance, I am going to overcome it, translate it, transmute it. If you are thinking in terms of gain, then you are looking to sensation, and action based on sensation does not give this true discernment.</p>
<p>What gives true discernment is action without choice. If action is based on achievement, then that action has no significance, that action is of time and therefore creates conflict; whereas, if there is action not from a reward, not from a punishment, not from fear, then action itself is inherently true and therefore enduring. What destroys action in its true significance is want, is this continual craving, which creates loneliness. Where there is want, one is conscious of loneliness, emptiness, a void, and immediately one wants something to fill that; so one goes on accumulating more and more, and the emptiness is still there. The cause of loneliness is want, because wherever there is want, there is no discernment. Want blinds and cripples the mind and heart from true understanding. You can only want, crave, when the mind is burdened with false values. The moment you understand a thing, wholly, completely in all its significance, there is no more want. You are part of it - whether the understanding of an experience, or a thing, or an idea, or an emotion. So wanting perverts judgment, true discernment, which is the cause of loneliness.</p>
<p>Now, I am going to explain something, which I hope will make what I am saying clear. Most people agree mentally; mentally you have followed. If you have followed what I have said the last three days, you will have followed that where there is want, there is lack of discernment. You will agree intellectually, but emotionally you are still wanting, and hence there is conflict. The mind imposes itself on the emotions that want - and hence the continual battle, the strain of what you call spirituality, the trying to force together the two elements that are warring with each other. So mind is convinced of the futility of comfort or of want; intellectually it is assured of its falseness; sensationally it still wants it, it is seeking sedulously and is unconsciously absorbed with it. Then what do you do? There it is, there are two elements in you: one that says no comfort, no security, no want, that intellectually, mentally sees the fallacy of it, and emotionally all the time holding - as is the case with love, what you call love, as a husband, a wife, a lover, which is a possessive thing - but intellectually you despise what you are doing.</p>
<p>What do you do? What does one do? One either gives it up as a hopeless thing, or else tries to dominate. Mentally you suppress the other, continually suffocate the search for comfort, the search for security, the search for want; so out of that there is discipline, there is the controller and the controlled and the desire to accumulate virtues to strengthen its own assurance, and there is this continual domination going on. Now, if you emotionally pursue the want, if you emotionally think security is essential for your well-being, pursue it, don’t try to dominate it. Investigate it, try to plumb its full depths, and in the discovery, in the penetration of want, you will discover the futility of want. I am afraid it is simple and you will miss it. If you want a thing, approach it wholly both with your mind and heart; look at it intellectually and emotionally. If you want comfort with all its implications of power, domination, take it with both your whole heart and mind, don’t separate your mind from want. Now you are intellectually developing, and therefore your mind’s response is always intellectual, which is the curse of modern education. Whereas, when you approach it wholly both with your mind and your heart, then you will find the true significance of want, that is, when you are fully aware of this hindrance. Want is a hindrance, from my point of view; probably it is not from yours. But to understand, whatever it is you want, approach it wholly as a harmonious being, not a conflicting being, whether it is jewels, cars, your wife, husband, even God, truth. Then you will approach it as a human being, not as a split individual. Hence, you never try to conquer any hindrance: you penetrate it, understand it, gather its significance, and then you are free from that particular hindrance, without effort. Effort only exists when there is contradiction in yourself between want and non-want, an observer who is observing the thing which wants.</p>
<p>That is why, to me, all discipline which you have imposed on yourself, all meditation - what you call meditation - appears so destructive. Otherwise, you will never understand the joy of eternity, the ecstasy of life in all its spontaneity, with all its natural feelings and expressions. If you hate, approach it not with a mind that says, “I must not hate,” and at the same time with a feeling of hate; approach it with all your being and you will see how quickly it disappears - like the morning mist which is dispelled by the sun. It is because we do not approach everything so inherently with our whole being that we pursue virtues, develop character, will, discipline, and search out reward.</p>
<p>Please, experiment with it. I am afraid you don’t experiment, because you have already made up your mind that discipline is necessary, control is essential, reward is worthwhile; otherwise, if there is no achievement, what is life? All these <i>clichés</i> are so instilled, drilled into your mind, that you don’t experiment with what I am saying, or you become sentimental. Experiment for a day and you will understand that you can live harmoniously, completely, with action that is infinite, not in terms of achievement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>In awareness, must there not be effort? If I find that I have habits that are useless, it requires effort to eliminate them, does it not? Yet, you speak of awareness as being effortless, spontaneous.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Effort exists as long as you are trying to conquer something, as long as you are seeking an achievement with success at the end of it; whereas, awareness is not born of gain or achievement or success, because achievement, success, implies time, choice. Awareness is choiceless, timeless. I have explained this very carefully during the last few days. Don’t mystify what I am saying; it is very simple. When you realize with your whole being that a habit or an idea or an emotion is futile, then you don’t make an effort. The habit may continue, but the decision is finished and the habit will gradually wear out. It is childish. I am sure you have experimented with it, and have found it so. Say you have a habit of scratching yourself. If you are fully conscious of it, if you are aware of it with your whole being, there is a decision. The habit may continue for a while, but it will disappear of its own accord. But now you are not fully conscious of the habit and you try to dominate it, and hence there is a continual desire to control your habit.</p>
<p>Awareness is direct discernment without choice. You can only discern directly, perceive immediately, when you approach the problem, that habit, or a crisis, with your whole being. Therefore it requires intense watchfulness, alertness. You do these things when you are interested in them. Now you are not interested in these things; the majority of people is not interested in what I am talking about. Why are they not interested? Because they like sensation, they want security, comfort, pleasure. Not that I am saying that you must not have these things; don’t jump to the opposite. Those things take minor importance when you are complete. I don’t mean that you must not have clothes, food, shelter, but they are not the first things; they have their right place. So please first find out, not what it is to be aware, but if you want to pursue that with all your being. If you want security, comfort, if you are craving all the time for achievement, success, virtue, approach it wholly - not with a tired, wearisome feeling, wanting and not wanting, seeing the absurdity of it intellectually and, at the same time, emotionally running after it. So, you cannot know awareness, nor can you maintain it if you are not interested enough to act wholly with both mind and heart, with your whole being. When you are interested, then out of that comes the flame of awareness. Then it is not a question of maintaining it all the time; it is there when the moment comes, when you approach everything fully; and then you are free of that particular impediment.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>I come to Star Camp because it is the most enjoyable way of spending a summer holiday that I know. During a summer holiday one gets more detached and takes stock. For that I do not want a lot of frivolities - there are cinemas all the year round. In taking stock, your challenge is a valuable part of the holiday. Is such a reason for coming of no value from your standpoint?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First of all, before I answer that question, let me say that when I smile, I am not laughing at the questioner, because humor is quite impersonal: it has nothing to do with you and me. So please, I am not laughing at the questioner. When the audience laughs, I am sure it is the same thing, they are not laughing at the questioner. The question implied that only during a certain part of the year you can take stock, not at other times. During these holidays at the Star Camp you have time and leisure, and my challenge helps you to take stock. It is like setting aside one hour of the day to meditate; the rest of the day there is no time. That is, your circumstances don’t allow you to take stock the rest of the year. You are so surrounded by family worries, by people, town, by activities, that you have no time to take stock. Here you have time; it is a beautiful place, though it occasionally rains, but here you can take stock.</p>
<p>What a false way of looking at it. Why cannot you take stock while living in the world? Because the world is too much? You are part of it. The world is not too much, you like to play with the toys of the world, and so you have no time nor interest nor leisure. This is not the moment to take stock, these ten days or three weeks. So, what you have done is to divide life as possible and not possible: the possible at the Star Camp and the impossible in daily life. Why is it not possible in your daily life? Because you have created it, individually you have created your daily life and you have become a slave to it, and therefore you say, I cannot take stock. I say, you can only take stock there and not here. Here you are stimulated by me. That is naturally a false sensation. This has been going on every year. Please don’t think I am harsh. On the contrary, if you were alive in your circumstances, you would break the circumstances and take stock in them. Now, you don’t want to break the circumstances and therefore you come here to find out, keeping the circumstances the whole time and, at the same time, trying to arrive at truth. You can’t do it. It is like a man that is having a lovely holiday in summertime. He sees mountains, tranquil lakes, and goes back to the beastly office. He hates it, but his mind is continually going back to that loveliness of the summer. Why not break the office routine, why not recreate afresh, anew, instead of all the time having a double life? Don’t give false reasons of responsibility and don’t say I cannot because of my mother and so on. The circumstances have been created by you through fear; you can only recreate them yourself and no one else can. That is what happens with the man who has summer holidays. He goes back to the daily surroundings and thereby he gradually destroys his sensitiveness. When he breaks the circumstances he finds out true values. Don’t say, I am afraid of hurting people, of changing circumstances, of responsibility. To find truth there must be no father or mother, nothing to stand in the way, no relationship, no responsibility. But please don’t take the opposite and say, “Good, I will give up all my responsibilities” - which is such an easy, cowardly way of doing it. In acting completely, then you will find out that no relationship, no bondage can stand in your way. To act completely, you must be complete. Your whole being must live and then nothing can stand in your way, no circumstances, whether a town or a camp.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Sometimes I hate everybody and everything. Can you advise me how to prevent this terrible feeling from surging up, because in those moments I am quite unable to get out of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Approach it, as I have said, with your whole being, as you approach love. When you love someone intensely, you do it with your whole substance, with your whole being; in that there is no conflict, in that you don’t say, how am I to get out? In the same way with hate, transient pleasures - all these things are to be approached wholly. You will then not get rid of them, but you will penetrate and find out their full significance, their true value, and from that there is action. So please don’t regard these things as something to be rid of, to be conquered. That approach prevents complete action and hence there is conflict; and you cannot surmount it, conquer it. It only creates further duality, further opposites. But if you approach it both with your heart and your mind, then it dissolves itself, then you can understand it fully, then a new element is born.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Thinking over what you said, I know that I am clinging to certain things. For instance, I am fond of jewels. I know that if I lost my ring, I would cheerfully accept the inevitable, but I would not like to give it to another person. So I am far from detached. I know - perhaps only mentally - that I would be happier or live more easily without these material things. Yet, I have the desire to possess them, and I have lots of other desires. How can I get rid of them?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If you want jewels, have jewels. Why do you want to get rid of them? Why do you want to give them to others? I am afraid you don’t follow what I have been talking about the last four days. You see, there is no such thing for me as renunciation. When you understand a thing, then it drops off. The outside person may call it renunciation, but for one that acts harmoniously it is no renunciation; it is natural action. The world praises such a man and says, what a wonderful man, calls him noble, spiritually puts him on a pedestal and worships him, because they themselves cannot do that. So, if you are still caught up in the sensation of jewels, possessions, what is wrong? There are millions of people who are slaves of possession. You are only another kind of a slave to another kind of possession. But you object to it because you are afraid of loss; you are afraid of becoming again lonely. You desire possessions, houses, and land, etc. because these things give you a certain security, a certain happiness, and you are afraid of losing the sensation of possession which gives you happiness.</p>
<p>Why are you a slave to that happiness of possession? Is it because in yourself there is no richness, in yourself there is no potential life dynamic? Therefore, you rely on all these tawdry things and say how much you must own and how much you must not own. In yourself, there is so much poverty that you rely on external possessions; whereas, if you were rich, you would not want all these things. Then you will have your houses, clothes, but they will have a minor importance; then you are a law unto yourself, you are free from all law, because you are complete. A thing that is harmonious is eternal because it is free from all transiency. So approach everything with all your being, and out of that the supreme act is born. With regard to everything - your clothes, your houses, your properties, your jewels, your wife and children - then you will know the infinite act.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You said, “Man, being free, is limited.” Is the liberated man limited? If yes, this means he is limited like the free man. Please explain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The liberated man is without choice, yet he acts from that aloneness, not from himself, but from that eternal aloneness. I am using that word not in the sense of retiring from the world, but that aloneness of true values which is eternal, neither yours nor mine. To such a man there is no choice, but to the man who is not liberated there is choice, and therefore he is limited. He is free to choose according to his likes and dislikes; therefore, he chooses, and thereby he is limited. Your choice is based on like and dislike, and you are free in this like and dislike, therefore it is limited. But if you are without choice, then you are truly liberated, then your action is divine, then you are pure action - that lovely thing.</p>
<p>So, where action is born out of choice, there must be limitation, because whatever act is born of an opposite must create another series of opposites, and hence you are caught in this continual duality of opposites, and hence ceaseless effort, ceaseless limitation. You may break down one limitation, but erect another.</p>
<p>If I am afraid, I am seeking courage. Then my courage is the opposite of fear, which does not free one of fear. I only escaped to what I call courage. But if I am free of fear, fear itself, then I am free of both courage and fear. So where there is choice there is conflict all the time, as yesterday, today, and tomorrow; and where action is without choice, time is a whole, there is no yesterday, today, and tomorrow. That is eternity, that is immortality.</p>
