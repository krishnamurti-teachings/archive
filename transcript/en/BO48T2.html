<p>The understanding of what is is arduous; for, what is is never static, it is in constant movement. A mind that wishes to understand it must be swift and pliable. All problems are always new and the mind must be fresh to grasp their full meaning. Every crisis is new and the mind must be unburdened by the past to understand it fully.</p>
<p>There is an urgency of inward revolution which alone can bring about a radical transformation in the outer circumstances of life, in society. Action without this constant inward revolution becomes repetitive, static. This action is society. This action of relationship between man and man is society. So society without this creative, psychological revolution is everbecoming crystallized and constantly has to be broken. Outward revolution has no significance without the inner, psychological transformation of the individual. In the social structure there is ever the seed of decay, and only the individual can ever be in constant and creative revolution. Society is always static, and only in the individual is there hope. Can there be any relationship between the creative, revolutionary individual and the ever static society? Social revolution through any means is always static, as there is no inward revolution of the individual. Mere change in the outward structure of man has little significance without psychological revolution of the individual. If relationship is not the outcome of inward revolution, then that relationship, which is the social structure, makes the individual static, repetitive. Each one is aware of the disintegrating factor in relationship, and so in the social structure of the present civilization.</p>
<p>It does not need specialists to tell us an obvious fact: that society is disintegrating, crumbling. So there must be new builders to create a new social order; the new structure must be built on a new foundation. The new architects are not the politicians of the left or of the right, nor are they any party specialists. The new architects must be you and me, the individual. To look to authority, to leaders, is to sustain disintegration. Through self-knowledge, you and I must rediscover lasting values; they must be newly discovered by each one.</p>
<p>So, you and I must become creative because the problem is urgent. You and I must be aware of the causes of the collapse of society, and build a new structure whose foundation is based on our creative understanding. This creative understanding is negative thinking, and negative thinking is the highest form of meditation. To understand what is creative thinking, we must approach the problem negatively. A positive approach to a problem is imitative and therefore disintegrating. For understanding comes not through any positive system or positive formula or conclusion, but through negative understanding.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental reasons for the disintegration of society is that you, as an individual, have been imitative outwardly and inwardly - outwardly the mere cultivation of technique, and inwardly copying, which comes from fear and the desire to be secure. Our education and our religious life is based on imitation, to fit into a formula, to be Hindus or Christians, Muslims or Buddhists. This prevents creative existence. Where there is imitation, there is the disintegrating factor of a leader. Where there is worship of authority, there must be disintegration also, which prevents creative understanding. In the happy moments of creativeness there is no repetition, no copying. Where there is regimentation and the worship of authority, there must be disintegration and collapse of true values. The substitution of one authority for another is still to be in conflict, and so there cannot be creative understanding.</p>
<p>Where there is becoming there must be copying and authority. Becoming creative admits the process of time. In becoming, there must be the authority, the example, the ideal, the tomorrow. In being, there is the cessation of time, and so it is a state of immediate transformation.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is your solution to the problem of starvation?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: The answer to any human problem lies in the problem itself. The answer is never outside the problem. If we can understand the problem itself with all its significance, then the answer comes. But, if you have a ready-made answer or a formula for the problem, then you will never understand the problem. For the answer, the conclusion, the formula intervenes between the problem and its understanding, which distorts the understanding of the problem.</p>
<p>Will any solution offered by any system, either of the left or of the right, put an end to starvation? When I am asked whether I have a solution to this question, in this question is implied whether I have a system which will put an end to starvation. Now, can any system bring about the ending of starvation? Why have systems become important? They have become important because we think they will solve the problem. Through a pattern of action we hope to solve this question. By outward compulsion it is hoped that man can be fed. Systems become important because each one thinks that through legislation, through compulsion, through some outward action, we can feed man.</p>
<p>Why have food, clothing, and shelter become so predominantly important in man's life? They are necessary, but why have they become such an all-consuming problem? Why have things made by the hand or by the mind become so extraordinarily significant in our lives? If we can answer this question, that is, if we can find the truth of this, then they will assume their true value, then they will not become the dominant influence in our lives. When systems become important, the feeding, clothing, and sheltering of man become of secondary importance; then we will kill man to maintain the system, and the problem of starvation will continue. If we do not look to a system, but understand what are the significant implications in the problem itself, then we will find the right means which will bring about the right end.</p>
<p>Why have you and I given such an extraordinary significance to property, whether made by the hand or by the mind? We give importance to sensate values because we use them as a psychological means for self-expansion. Property has very little meaning in itself; but property becomes extraordinarily significant in giving you power, position, prestige, and so on. Since it gives you power and authority, you cling to it, and on this you build a system which destroys compassion and generosity and thereby the feeding of man. So long as you and I use property, name, belief - which are food, clothes, and shelter on a different level - as a means of self-expansion, there must be starvation, conflict between man and man. As long as the state or a group of people are using food, clothing, and shelter as a means of gaining power, starvation will continue. So, a system does not offer a solution to the problem of starvation; a system is ever in the hands of a few, and so the system becomes important. Only when you and I are aware that we are using property - things made by the hand or by the mind - as a means of self-expansion, and see the falseness of such an action, then only can there be happiness in our relationship with man. After all, take away your name, your title, your possessions, what are you? You are nothing. To cover up this fear of being nothing, property, name, family, ideas become all-important. This psychological emptiness of man must be understood and not covered up; and to understand it, there must be the freedom from the desire for self-expansion through property, family, idea. So, this question of starvation is more a psychological problem than mere legislation and enforcement. If you see the truth of this, then you put an end to the process of self-expansion through essential needs, and therefore help to bring about a new social order. If you do not give predominance to sensate values, then this problem can be solved simply, then the scientists and others can give us all food, clothes, and shelter. But as they themselves are caught in the self-expansive process, they are not a help to man. So, the solution of the problem lies in your understanding of this self-expansive process, and its disintegrating action in your relationship to essential needs. If you truly understand this, there will be an inner revolution which will create a new social structure.</p>
<p>In understanding what is, truth comes into being. It is the perception of truth that is liberating and not the clever systems or ideation. Ideas breed further ideas and opposition, and in no way bring happiness to man. Only when ideation ceases is there being, and this being is the immediate transformation, which truth alone gives.</p>
<p>Questioner: You say we can remain aware even in sleep. Please explain.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Consciousness is of many layers. It is not merely a superficial layer. Consciousness is made up of hidden intentions, unrevealed motives, unsolved problems, tradition, memory, the impingement of the past on the present, the continuation of the past through the present to the future: all this and more is consciousness. This is not a theory, but we are studying what is. This is actually what is consciousness. The many layers of memories, the many unsolved problems which we call memory, the racial instincts, the past in conjunction with the present, which is time giving birth to the future - all this is consciousness.</p>
<p>Now most of us are functioning within the superficial layers of consciousness. As I see that some of you are not interested in what is being said, please listen to it merely as information. But, if you will go into it deeper, you will see that what I have said is a fact. As I have said, I have not studied any religious or psychological books. I am not using any jargon of the psychologists. Being aware of oneself, one discovers all these and greater things. In one's self is the whole of wisdom. Self-knowledge is the beginning of meditation, and without self-knowledge there is no right thinking. Without self-knowledge, there is no basis for thought. We are exploring consciousness, and you can explore it directly as I am talking; be aware and experience, not merely verbally.</p>
<p>As I was saying, most of us function in the superficial layers of consciousness, so we remain shallow and our action brings further confusion and misery. There is liberation from sorrow only when the whole of consciousness is fully and deeply understood - which is not a matter of time.</p>
<p>Since we function within the superficial layers of consciousness, naturally action creates problems. Such action can never solve our problems. These superficial layers are always the breeding ground of problems. Most of our daily activities are the responses of these superficially cultivated layers. Now when you have a problem, you try to solve it superficially, worrying over it, struggling with it as a dog with a bone; and yet, you do not find the right solution for it. Then what happens? You go to bed with it, and when you wake up, you have either seen a new way of looking at it, or you have solved it. In this there is nothing extraordinary or mysterious. These superficial layers of consciousness have thought about this problem during the day, trying to translate it according to its immediate demands and prejudices. During the so-called sleep, the superficial consciousness is somewhat quiet, relaxed, temporarily inactive. Then, into that superficial layer, the hidden projects its intimation which becomes the solution. So, when you wake up and when the superficial layer becomes active, the problem is reexamined and understood. This process is not reserved for the occultists nor the dream experts; it is in everyday life an obvious fact which can be observed by you, for yourself. The superficial layers can be quieted during the day, and the problem understood directly, if you are open to the intimation of the hidden layers of consciousness.</p>
<p>The next point involved in this question is the intimation of the hidden layers of consciousness. Most people live a superficial existence, unaware of the vast hidden sources, treasures of extraordinary importance, of great delight and joy. Because we are unaware during the waking hours of these movements, they appear as dreams when we are asleep. Because the superficial layers of consciousness are active during the waking hours, and do not receive the intimations of the hidden, such intimations become dreams. These dreams need interpretation, and the expert interpreter comes in and becomes important. There need be no interpretation if there is constant and direct contact with the hidden layers of consciousness. This can happen only when the mind has a space interval between thought and thought and between action and action.</p>
<p>Then, the other point involved in this question is that of subjective experience, such as conversation with another, remembering words, remembering scenes and various activities. I do not know if it has happened to you that, upon waking, you remember having had a long talk with somebody, remembering words or a word of extraordinary significance and potency, having had a discussion with a friend, with a guru, with a Master, and so on. Now, what are all these subjective activities or experiences? Is not all this within the field of consciousness, and therefore a projection of itself which is translated upon waking as a conversation, a direction received from a Master, and so on. But the discussion and the Master are still within the field of consciousness, and so a projection of its own content as a Master, a word, a scene, giving them significance.</p>
<p>So, the remembrance of an event within the field of consciousness is still an intimation or projection of thought, and therefore a product of thought, and therefore not the real. Reality comes into being when thought ceases, when thought is not creating.</p>
<p>The next point involved in this question is whether during sleep it is possible objectively to meet a person. What is the person? The person is obviously identified thought. The objective person whom you met in sleep is only his thought which he projected and which is identified with him by you. This identified thought you meet objectively. You are also the identified thought which is constantly projecting itself. Thought, which is like a wave, is identified, given a name; and that you meet objectively, which assumes the form of a person.</p>
<p>But all these explanations have no meaning whatsoever without self-knowledge. You may repeat what I said, but repetition is a lie; it is mere propaganda and is not true. These things must be experienced. The division between the superficial layers of consciousness and the deeper layers is very narrow. Since most of us are occupied with the waking consciousness, with its worries, with the earning of a livelihood, the tension of relationship, the anxiety of belief - all these prevent the exploration of yourself at deeper levels. You cannot dig consciously into the deeper layers of consciousness, for any action on the part of the superficial mind becomes a hindrance to the uncovering of the deeper layers. But when the conscious mind is still, the hidden projects itself swiftly. When in those silent moments the hidden gives its intimation, there is a new joy, a new understanding. This joy and this understanding we translate into immediate action; or, we want the joy to be repeated. This craving for repetition prevents further intimation and further joy.</p>
<p>What is important is to understand that there cannot be right thinking and so right action without self-knowledge. This knowledge is not limited to the superficial layers of consciousness, but is the complete understanding of the whole process of consciousness. This understanding is not a matter of time. If there is intention to understand, then there is perception, and the urgency of that intention depends on honesty. The passive and yet alert awareness unfolds the deeper depths of consciousness. The discovery and experiencing of what is brings creative joy. In understanding what is without your interpretation, truth comes into being, and it is this truth which liberates and gives joy.</p>
<p>Questioner: You say that full awareness of the problem liberates us from it. Awareness depends on interest. What creates interest? What makes one man interested and another indifferent?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: To understand a problem, no previous conclusion or answer must intervene between yourself and the problem. Because our minds are filled with conclusions and remembrances of responses, we are never directly in relationship with the problem. We either quote religious books or the assertion of leaders or gurus, which prevents the complete understanding of the problem. We are never directly in relationship with the problem. There is a screen between us and the problem - the screen of quotation, of conclusion, a favorable answer - which prevents the full significance of the problem from being understood. So, to be aware of a problem directly is extremely arduous. Now, let us experiment with this. If you have a problem, what is your response to it? Your instinctive response is to look for an answer. This search for a solution indicates the avoidance of the problem, and not the comprehension of the problem. When you are aware that you are seeking an answer rather than the understanding of the problem, the search for an answer is put aside, and you are directly confronted with the problem. When you are thus directly confronted with the problem, you will begin to be aware of the full significance of the problem, and the problem will yield its full content and will cease to be. To fully understand a problem is to be aware of the escapes. These escapes take different forms - the desire for a solution, the acceptance of authority, memory as conclusion, and so on - and if you are not aware of them, emphasis is laid on the escapes and not on the problem itself.</p>
<p>Now, every problem is a new problem, a new challenge. Life is a process of challenge and response. This challenge is ever new; but the response is ever conditioned and limited, and the challenge is always translated in terms of the old, and so there is never understanding of the problem or of the challenge completely. We meet the challenge anew at moments of great crisis.</p>
<p>Interest in a problem is either stimulated, or the very urgency of the problem itself demands it. If it comes into being through influence, it soon fades away. Nothing real can be discerned through influence, through stimulation. To be influenced is to lose the pliability of action. A man who is influenced soon loses the integrity of his own experience and understanding. Where there is earnestness, there is interest, and that earnestness does not depend on moods. Earnestness is not a thing to be cultivated. Where there is sorrow and not an avoidance of it, there is earnestness. If you are not interested in the understanding of sorrow, mere stimulation or influence cannot bring about a sustained exertion. Stimulation and influence soon weary the mind, leaving it dull and wasted.</p>
<p>What makes us indifferent? Why is there no vital, significant interest in our action? Is it not because our minds are distracted? The cinema, the guru, the temple, and drinking help us to avoid the intensity and the purposive direction of our lives. They are distractions, and distractions inevitably dull the mind. The guru and drinking, though momentarily stimulating, destroy the swift pliability of the mind. Because you desire gratification and not understanding, you pursue distractions which inevitably weary the mind. Most of us are not open to sorrow - we avoid it. Being discontented, we try to run away from discontent. Thus, thought itself becomes a distraction.</p>
<p>What is important is to find out why each one of us is indifferent or superficial. Why is one caught in this net of suffering? The answer lies in discerning for oneself the causes that make one dull and insensitive to suffering, to the open skies, to the passing birds, to the tears of our relationship. To be sensitive is to be vulnerable, and it is only in that state of sensitivity that understanding can come.</p>
