<p>I am not using the word <i>action</i> in any way philosophically; I am using it ordinarily. To the majority of people, when you talk about action, it means physical movement. But to me, it is completeness of thinking, feeling, and acting. All that makes an act, not merely to move a thing from here to there or doing a physical act. Even that demands a thought and a feeling which lies behind it.</p>
<p>So to me, when I use the word <i>action</i>, it implies the whole of thought, feeling, and action. When it is harmonious, when a thought is born or there is emotion and hence action, out of that completeness, out of that harmonious thinking, feeling, and acting, then that act is infinite, and to me such action is complete; in it there are no hindrances, no distinction or resistance between thought, emotion, and action. To me, to think is to act, or to feel is to act; you cannot separate thinking, feeling, and acting into three different thing - it is all one. To me, to feel is to think, or to act is to think and to feel, so you cannot separate - at least I do not separate. Action, then, is whole; action is the outcome of a complete unity of mind and heart and action.</p>
<p>Now, to understand action being infinite - not a finality, not an achievement, a goal, or an end - to understand such an action, you must understand what you mean by action, what each one of you means by action. I will try and say what I think one generally means by action.</p>
<p>Action means conformity to the majority of people: imitation, or struggling to reach an end, a result. So action means, generally, self-preservation. You may not mean it in its gross sense, but we have refined it so much, spiritualized it, that self-preservation has become quite spiritual. What you mean by action is conformity, and I am going to try and explain that your action is conformity; it is not spontaneous, it is not natural, full, complete. It is always conforming.</p>
<p>You put one action before another in importance. Take the man who says that, by having bread first, the whole of life will be understood. That is, solve the economic difficulties and the other things will follow. Or, the man who says, “Understand the spiritual life first, and the bread difficulty will be solved.” We have divided our action as physical, which is economic, social, and religious. Those are our acts, and we think economic acts have nothing to do with our social acts, which in turn have nothing to do with our religious acts.</p>
<p>Now, if you think about your economic act, it is all based on self-preservation: in business, in the acquisition of property, power. There you are acting through a particular idea, and therefore your action is always conforming. Economically your idea is to exploit and to be exploited, that is, to lay up for yourself in the future a certain amount of money so that you will have security. Where there is security, there must be authority and hence power, inheritance, etc. So you have established what the end is, and you are acting according to that idea, which you call business, but which is self-preservation. So our action is not natural - I am using the word <i>natural</i> in what is to me the right sense of the word - that is, that action is independent, it is not complete, not harmonious.</p>
<p>You say, “I must earn, otherwise society will destroy me. I must lay up for the future, otherwise who will look after me in my old age? There must be inheritance, otherwise I cannot transmit what I have gained to my son.” All this is based on the idea of self-preservation, handing down your name, the things you have accumulated, etc. So your action is always being limited, is independent of what you think and feel, like the man who says, “Bread first.” So you say, “Let me act so as to have security, power, and then I will act differently, socially, spiritually.”</p>
<p>So, what have you established? You have established what you think is the finality of an economic goal, and you are working towards that all the time; so your action is all the time an imitation, a conformity. Therefore, you are not, from my point of view, acting. That is, you are not a complete being in your business.</p>
<p>Again, socially, we are trying to fit into a pattern, and therefore our action is but conformity; or we have certain ideas of class distinction, and we are acting according to that distinction. That is, socially we are making ourselves, by our actions, perfect machines, cogs, that will fit into the social mechanism without the least conflict. So our action is disharmonious. We may think differently, we may earn, do business differently, but we are trying all the time to cover all this up and fit in socially. So, again, our action is disharmonious, and to me such action is not a true act.</p>
<p>Then again, religiously, spiritually, or ethically, we are all the time afraid. Our actions, that is, our thinking and our feeling, are born of fear. All our religious ceremonies, our offerings to gods, and our spiritual authority, all that is self-immolation, which we think will bring about right balance - “Because I have been cruel, therefore I am going to be cruel to myself,” hoping that will bring about right balance in your thought. Or, having an idea of what God, truth is, and acting according to that idea.</p>
<p>So, when you look to your action, you will see that your business action, your social action, and your religious actions have nothing to do with it. They indicate, in a very subtle sense, that you want to preserve yourself as an entity.</p>
<p>We have intellectually said that self-preservation is very selfish, so though we go on earning, exploiting, and being exploited, we are all the time covering that up and spiritually running away into truth. So our actions are not harmonious. And you will only understand that action which is complete, and therefore infinite, when you do your business, your social activity, your religious idea as a whole thing. Then you are a complete human being. That means that one has to think quite differently and to feel quite differently from the way in which we are accustomed to.</p>
<p>You will at once say, “What will happen if I do not lay up money?” You will see. You are looking to security, and therefore your actions are always limited through fear, and yet you are trying not to be afraid. So your actions are contradictory. Your actions are not complete in the present, because you are looking to the future when you lay up and wonder what is going to happen to you when you are sixty.</p>
<p>Again, when you want to fit into society, into the social machine - because that feeling is so strong - you are afraid to go against it, afraid to be yourselves. Or, religiously, it is exactly the same thing: our actions are not born out of a completeness of thinking and feeling, because we never face these things all together at the same time. We are trying to solve economic difficulties through economic conditions by altering the economic system. We say we will alter that carefully and we will be perfect along that line - and the same thing socially and spiritually. We do not bring it all together and act completely as a human being. So our actions are broken up, split up, and hence they are conforming all the time and we are unconscious of it. So to understand that wholeness, that fullness of life, do not try to make the economic system perfect, independent of your social and religious life; and do not make your spiritual life perfect away from your social and economic life.</p>
<p>This is really very simple. You can see for yourself how you are acting. You have a spiritual standard, a social standard, and a business standard, and you are acting according to these standards, and you call that action. Such action, to me, is purely imitating. It is not action at all; it is just copying. In it, there is no thinking, real individual thinking, questioning.</p>
<p>I said yesterday that you are trying to approach the wholeness through the part. You say, “I will make the economic condition perfect, or the social condition perfect, or the spiritual condition perfect, and I will get the whole.” You cannot. You must approach it completely, and your actions must be complete. That means that to think is to act - you cannot separate it - to feel is to act. You cannot divide and say, “I will feel one thing and act another,” or, “I will think one thing and feel another.” In such action there is always a finality, and hence there is fear of death, of unfulfilled opportunities, and therefore a looking to the future.</p>
<p>But when you act completely, that action is infinite. And you will not understand what that is until your business, social, and religious life are completely harmonized. You may not be afraid of what lies in the hereafter or for spiritual authority - you may have given up all your religions and ceremonies - but you are afraid of what will happen when you become old, so you say, “Let me lay up for the future”; or, you are afraid unconsciously of what another may say.</p>
<p>Don’t you see, when you tackle it as a whole, fear disappears. You do not divide fear into spiritual, economic, and social. It is fear. So, when you tackle and try to understand fear, then your actions will not be separative.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>In the very act of thinking and puzzling over what you have said, we are making an effort towards getting rid of hindrances - are we then not creating another barrier by thinking over this thing at all? If not, in what sense do we use the word</span> effort?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>When we talk about thinking, what do we mean? Our thinking is but a reaction, as I have tried to show just now. You’re thinking from a background which you have established, and so you are merely reacting. I do not call that thinking. The questioner wants to know if, in thinking and puzzling over what I have said, we are making an effort to get rid of hindrances. You see, when I use the word <i>effort</i> to imply a reaching after, exertion towards an end, straining after, trying to conquer, achieving, changing, molding, imitating, that is what I mean by effort: endeavoring, struggling after, reaching after.</p>
<p>Now, our whole mind is made up of it, our whole attitude towards life is that, isn’t it? You want truth, you want to get rid of hindrances, you want self-preservation, you must have money laid up for the future, you are afraid so you must get rid of fear. So our thinking is in terms of achieving, of achievement. We are puzzling in order to arrive at a conclusion, at an end, like a cross-word puzzle. We want to reach an end and so we are making an effort.</p>
<p>Is not one secretively seeking power, which you call self-preservation, or which you call an ideal, or truth? You want to be well-established; you want to know you will exist; so you look after yourself, so that you can lay up your money; when you become old you can be safe, secure. So your whole action is based on that, and naturally you are afraid that security will be destroyed. So you are making constant endeavor, effort, to maintain that security - economically, socially, and spiritually. I am not talking about an effort with regard to, when I feel pain I must get rid of it, or, when I am deaf I must try to find a way to cure it. I am not talking about such a thing. If you understand this principal thing, you will understand where effort is to be used for ordinary things.</p>
<p>Where there is a desire for achievement there must be effort. Where there is understanding there is no effort. Understanding is born out of a complete act. When you want to understand a thing, or when there is a problem which you have to solve, over which you have to decide, you are not trying to conquer it, you are not trying to evade it. You come to it when it is really vital with all your being, don’t you? When something is urgent you must decide with your whole being. In that you don’t make an effort, because you are not trying to come to the end of that problem. You are trying to find out. Take a flower. It grows naturally. Don’t say, “Is not the very growth an effort?” I am not applying that word <i>effort</i> to natural growth. Because one is abnormal, unnatural, we think by making tremendous effort we shall come to normality; by going through this effort, by analyzing, by continual watching, we think we will come to normality. I say you won’t. Whereas, if you are aware what creates abnormality - which you will find out when that abnormality becomes a crisis in your life - and when you are not trying to escape or solve it, then you will find out without effort how to be natural. When you have to decide something vital you sow the seed in your mind as well as in your heart, and you let it grow rightly, and then it comes out naturally. You are doing it all the time when you are concerned with something vitally; you are letting your emotions and your thoughts ripen together in the warmth of action, in the movement of action.</p>
<p>But what happens now? We try to decide a thing either intellectually or emotionally, not together. You want a jewel emotionally; it gives you a sensation, value. Intellectually we say, “How absurd it is!” Hence there is conflict, hence the effort to overcome. But when you bring them together, let them ripen, find out, experiment, do not identify with one or the other, then you will see. Our action now is the continual sharpening of mind and heart, as you take a stick and sharpen it with a knife. What happens? The more and more you sharpen it, the less and less stick. There is no stick at the end, no piece of wood. That is what you are doing, sharpening your mind and your heart. So, gradually as you grow there is less and less of mind and heart, and that is what you call effort, making the mind sharp and the emotions sharp - to run away, to seek a solution, not to understand the fullness of mind, the depth of emotion, but to achieve a pinnacle of sharpness, which is nothing. A mind that is not sharp but subtle, therefore deep, delicate - such a mind and heart will know that swift movement of action. You think through friction, friction of knowledge, friction of experience, through action, you can make your mind very sharp to find out truth. To find out, to understand, there must be depth of mind, not sharpness, which is but cleverness, superficiality. So, all our endeavor is like sharpening that stick with a knife, because you think in terms of achievement. Therefore, the more and more effort you make, the more you are destroying. A mind and heart that are really harmonious, therefore deep, profound, will understand that wholeness of life. That wholeness of life is not a reward for harmonious action. In harmonious action it is there. But you cannot come to harmonious action through effort, by saying, “I will get rid of hindrances.”</p>
<p>I have been over this yesterday, and the day before, and last week. I think either you do not hear or you are here for amusement. I have been trying to put it different ways. Please, I am not disappointed. It does not matter; I will go on. You will go away, all over the world, and I will go somewhere else, but you will emerge out of this with more confusion, I am afraid, because you are not thinking. You have layers of thinking in your mind, and you put what I am saying in one of those layers. I say, all those layers must disappear. But you are unconscious that you have layers. Become conscious in your movement of action.</p>
<p>I am saying nothing very complicated. When your action is imitative, it is no action at all. Your thinking is but reaction. In that there is not spontaneity because your thinking is born out of false values which you have never questioned. You have never questioned your background; you have never broken away from it and doubted it. You want to conform, and what I am talking about has nothing to do with conformity, with imitative act. You are seeking a method. Method implies an end, the end of achievement, spiritually. So with all this in your mind, choking it, you are trying to understand what I am saying. Naturally the two cannot fit in. Don’t try to understand me, but try to understand yourself, not what I am talking about. Now you are making an effort to understand what I am talking about - don’t. Become aware of your own thinking and feeling, that is all, not what I am talking about. Then, when you become aware of your action, you will find out that what I am talking about is true. Then you need not make an effort. You are trying to impose and put on top of a mind that is heavy, dull, jaded, dreary, without value, all that I am saying and trying to see through all that rubbish. Please, I am not talking through harshness, because life is far too short. We cannot go on like that every year. Either you want to live harmoniously or not. If you don’t, don’t come here and spoil your amusement and that of others. Don’t you see you have to think anew, think differently, not in your old habitual way, which is reaction, which is not thinking?</p>
<p>As you have collected so many false values and you are acting from that, question those values that you have collected. Don’t add more. Question what you have collected. And you can only question that, not intellectually, but in the movement of action. Surely that is very simple. That does not demand an effort. You make an effort when you are not interested, when you are trying to be spiritual, with haggard faces. But if you are interested, that is, when you are really suffering, or when there is a tremendous problem that you have to decide, then in that movement you will find out what are the hindrances that are holding you. Don’t you see your own lives are so miserable? What is the good of talking on my ecstasy? Your own lives are so poor, so shallow - that is why I say, become aware of that shallowness, understand, begin anew; then you will find out. In knowing that you are shallow you will discover riches; in knowing that you are incapable of thinking freely, feeling naturally, in knowing that - when you have really felt it and know it - then you will act differently. Now we are trying to be both, which is compromise.</p>
<p>When there is conformity, authority, effort, there cannot be rich living. Now, do not take that and add to your wastepaper basket, but question those things that you have already collected, of which your mind and heart are so full. And to question don’t dig into it, don’t analyze the past, but begin to act harmoniously with your full being; then all the impediments that you have collected will come into activity, and in that activity they will dissolve, not otherwise. You cannot learn from a dead thing; you can only learn from a living thing. All you have collected are dead things. You know, I could weep over this. I can talk, and you shake your heads, but you don’t see the absolute necessity to think wholly anew. And yet sorrow waits round each corner; with each experience, though you get joy out of it, there is sorrow because you do not know how to meet it. So we proceed until we die. Then we want a new life, to start it all over again, and we call that hope.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Can you make clearer the difference between the solving of one problem - which you say will not lead us to truth - and the understanding of one experience in the movement of action - which you say will lead us to truth?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First of all, no action will lead you to truth. Action itself is truth. You see, because you are looking through action to get something, action has no meaning. You say, “If I am righteous, I shall go to heaven,” therefore the importance of heaven. Or you want a title, so you will behave rightly according to the edicts of society. No action is ever going to lead you to truth. If it does, it is not true, nor is it an act. Surely, that is clear. If you love me because you think I am going to give you truth, of what value is your love? And I am afraid that is what is happening. You want something and therefore you are acting. Your wanting is not real, nor has your action true value. No action of any kind - love, service, work, accumulation of virtues - will bring you that everlasting ecstasy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>What is the difference between the solving of one problem and the understanding of one experience in the movement of action?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What are you doing, when you are trying to solve a problem? You are seeking a result, trying to get over that problem, trying to conquer that trouble. When you say, “I have a problem, please tell me the way out,” you are not concerned with the cause of the problem, you want to know what is the way out. It is the same thing with the economic problem. We say, “What is the way out of all this,” not, “What causes that problem?” Therefore, when I try to solve that problem, whenever I use the word <i>solve</i> it means I am trying to run away, trying to replace it by some other thing, by some other action, thought, or feeling, so that I immediately create another problem.</p>
<p>Take the problem of sex, or the problem of ceremony. Now you will all sit up; there is a tension. What a strange world! Why is it a problem to you and why are you trying to overcome it, saying, “Sex is a tremendous problem” or, “Ceremony is a problem. What am I to do? Tell me the way. Can I do occult practices so as to transmute my feelings into something else?”</p>
<p>That problem exists because you are not in yourself potential; you are not rich in yourself, therefore the less becomes the more. So by trying to solve your problem of sex, or any other problem, you are not getting richer; there is not that richness. Whereas, when there is completeness in action, in yourself, then all these problems will disappear. So in trying to solve a problem, you do not come to the richness of life, because you are only dealing with and trying to solve the part, not trying to understand the whole.</p>
<p>If one experience is understood, you will know the richness, that rich plenitude of life. When you have an experience, if you meet it, not as you do now, partly mentally and partly emotionally, but completely with both your mind and heart, then all the past hindrances come into being. The whole cause of your emptiness is known in one movement of life, whatever that movement is. That means you must be awake, not lazy, not jaded, with your mind and your heart crippled with fear. As it is crippled with fear, with imitation, with thoughtlessness, with false values, you can only find out in the movement of experience, which is in the present. You see that? Well, there it is!</p>
<p>There is a difference, a vast difference between the two. You cannot put them together. The one reveals the creator of illusions. One experience reveals the creator of illusions, and becoming conscious of the illusion, it dissolves; that is, the creator of illusions, when it becomes self-conscious in its own understanding, the illusion is dissolved. The way that you are trying to solve problem after problem - economic, social, religious, sexual, all the rest of it - one by one, that is, by trying to solve a part and hoping to understand the whole - you will never do it, because you will but create more illusions, because you don’t go to the creator of illusions, which is your own want. Eternal craving is the cause.</p>
<p>You will find out the cause, which is craving, when you meet experience rightly, that is, wholly, undividedly. In that undivided movement of action you will discover all the false values you have accumulated for generations, and in that moment of full awareness you will find out, like a fresh breath that destroys all the foul air at one moment, it is all gone. You cannot experiment, because experimentation means action, and you are afraid of action; you are afraid to move out of the old ruts - business, spiritual, social. You want to go along the same way and say what other people are saying. So, naturally, you are confused more and more. But if you question the rut along which you are running and discover that full value, meet everything wholly, then what I am saying will not be confused, will be so simple you will be astonished that you did not see it yourself.</p>
<p>So, friends, truth is not a thing to be found, attained, or realized. I may have used the words in the past - and I have used them - but I did not mean as an end to be gained, as you have made of them. I might have given the meaning to them, but it was not in my mind or heart that it is an end to be achieved. Besides, I wish you would scrap all the past and start anew. Nor is that fullness of life to be discovered through an action, but it is known only - that perfume, that richness, that ecstasy - in the fullness of action, not through, but in itself, whatever that action - your earning money, your ceremony, your sexual problem. It is in that action itself that the whole glory of life lies; it is not <i>through</i> it. Action inherently in itself, when you meet it in the movement of action, of experience, with full awareness, in that lies the glory.</p>
