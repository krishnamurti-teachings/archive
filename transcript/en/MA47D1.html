<p>Before we begin to discuss I would like to say something about the discussion and its purpose. First of all it is not a club for disputation and argumentation. We have tried in Europe and in America having different groups of different types of people s HYPERLINK "th.it" o that we went into things that we thought were very important and we continued such clubs for a couple of months or even sometimes longer. At the end of it some, I really think, did understand and similarly I hope during these months or weeks of discussion we will get somewhere. I feel each one of us must discover or prepare the field so that reality comes into being, because that reality is the only solution of our problems whether economic, social or religious or the problem of relationship between ourselves. Without the realisation of that I do not see how any problem in the world can be solved and that is my intention in holding these discussions so as to help each other to realise it and it is going to be very arduous because it requires real revolution in thinking. Not merely verbally but revolution in all the phases of our life and I feel that it is a matter of life and death. Therefore before we begin to discuss we must know our various intentions that is the relationship between yourself and myself. I may want to go to north and you may want to go to south, We may eventually meet, because south and North do meet, because the earth is round. We are going to discover what are our intentions during these discussions. So please bear in mind the importance of establishing relationship between ourselves so that we both may go to the same direction, not compulsorily, but eventually, naturally, and spontaneously. This is not a compulsion but before we begin to discuss anything really we ought to know our intentions, what is that we want, or what it is that you are unconsciously, deeply seeking. If we can find that our problems become comparatively simple.</p>
<p>Another point in discussion is that I will use words which have meaning to me and may not have to you. There has been in America a special study made by a great mathematician on the meaning of word. There are people who come and discuss these things with us and I am therefore able to pass it on to you. I do not read philosophies, religious books or anything of this kind. I am just telling you the way I am using words. I am using them very carefully because they have a meaning to me. It is not only verbally made clear but it must have a nervous response also. I do not know if you have ever thought about it. Words have the verbal meaning as well as the nervous response. Take for example the word 'God'. It has a verbal as well as nervous response. I am going to use very simple and straight language which I am willing to explain very carefully.</p>
<p>These discussions should not deteriorate into mere argumentation nor should we indulge in verbal expression. I think we meet for a definite purpose, which do not want to foist that purpose on to you. We want to discuss together so that we can see something which is beyond words, beyond emotional, sentimental or intellectual fraud. And that can only be done if we each one of us are willing to expose ourselves. These discussions should give an opportunity to understand ourselves. As it is not questioning and answering, do not put questions and wait for my answer. We travel together on a journey. I may perhaps know a little more than you do. You are also travelling on that road. You do not have to sit on the road side and know little about the journey. We are making the same journey and discovering together. It is like unfolding a map and seeing the various towns in their proper places and get to the right path and proceeding. Then this is a mutual discovery. It is a revelation. Then it is extraordinarily liberating than merely to stand on the road side viewing. If we are willing to undertake the journey together, it will be a process of self-discovery and therefore self-understanding, from which we begin to think rightly and therefore act rightly.</p>
<p>With these opening remarks from the chair [Krishnaji] the discussion started and the following problem was put forward for discussion by a lady:-</p>
<p>WHAT ARE THE CHIEF OBSTACLES THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF OUR UNDERSTANDING. Introducing the same for discussion to the audience the President [Krishnaji] said:-</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that these discussions are not meant for putting questions and answering the same, which I am proposing to do on every Sunday. First of all why do we ask such a question? When we ask such a question we should bear in mind the purpose of this discussion which is by discussing [with] each other we learn to know the process of our thinking so as to be aware of the total process of a human being. In understanding ourselves we shall understand the whole process of existence so as to be away from these calamities, miseries and confusion. So the question is what are the impediments, the blockages that prevent us from understanding. Why do we ask such a question? What is the motive behind that question? Why do we not understand? Obviously I do not understand for the simple reason that I do not see things as they are. I see things with a bias, on an angle, with a prejudice, with a desire to escape from the problem. These are not the only blockages but there are also subconscious blockages.</p>
<p>The following are some of the opinions expressed by the audience:- thinking. I want to understand because I want to get something from that understanding and so I see that I am puzzled at every step''.</p>
<p>Proceeding with the discussion the President [Krishnaji] emphasised the fact that one of the reasons for not understanding is an intellectual or verbal or authoritarian conclusion.</p>
<p>Further discussion centred round the subject whether a workable hypothesis or conclusion is necessary to solve our problems.</p>
<p>One of the members said that by arriving at conclusions we are sticking to the same and therefore stop thinking. But the problem is ever changing.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the point the President [Krishnaji] said:-</p>
<p>Our problems are not static. It is ever changing. If we do not also change we will not be able to solve the same. So in order to understand the problem we must be as alert as the problem itself. Therefore a conclusion about any problem is a hindrance. We are not discussing a mathematical problem like 2 and 2 make four. That is a static one.</p>
<p>One of the members expressed the opinion that a working hypothesis is necessary to understand a problem. When that hypothesis is found to be wrong or incorrect it will be replaced by another until finally we reach the correct one.</p>
<p>Conclusion is a picture of the past but problems are changing and in applying the past conclusions we may not be able to solve the present problems.</p>
<p>The opinion was expressed that though the problem is changing the fundamental problem remains the same, and no-body can deny this same.</p>
<p>A workable formula or conclusion seems to be necessary so that we may have a definite picture of the problem ourselves, otherwise it will be in a mess of facts.</p>
<p>Contradicting this view point the President [Krishnaji] cited the example of a desire to understand one's own son. For the purpose of understanding your son you have discussed with all the Professors and Educational experts in the world and drawn some conclusions from them and come home and look at the son. Is this the way of studying the son?</p>
<p>Asserting that right conclusions are necessary to solve a formulae [problem], one of the audience cited the example of the blind men who went to see the elephant and thought about the elephant in several ways. But the person who is not blind saw the elephant correctly and arrived at right conclusions.</p>
<p>Describing the working hypothesis or conclusions as a choultry [a Hindu caravansary W.S-06] on the high road the President [Krishnaji]said;-</p>
<p>By arriving at conclusions the implications of knowledge our are drained [drowned]. To understand a living problem one should be alert and watchful and he must follow the movement of life as quickly and rightly as possible. If we have a ready made hypothesis or conclusion surely that means we have not understood life. We are unwilling to relinquish the past and look at something new. This shows our incapability of understanding reality.</p>
<p>A doubt was expressed whether the very conclusion that any conclusion is a hindrance is not a conclusion, and therefore a hindrance.</p>
<p>Dealing with the same the President [Krishnaji]said:-</p>
<p>It becomes a hindrance if we verbally accept it. But if we see the truth of that matter is not an hindrance. You have discovered that truth. It is not a conclusion. Conclusion can only be an impediment if it remains on the verbal level. But if you discovered facts by thinking about it the same is not conclusion. We know that truth is the liberating factor and that is something which we see inevitably and not as a conclusion. In realizing this fact it is not arriving at any conclusion.</p>
