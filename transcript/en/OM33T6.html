<p>There is so much sorrow, so much suffering, and one becomes so conscious of that insufficiency to do anything about it, that one begins to seek what truth is. Because one suffers, one thinks one can find out the end of all sorrow, and so one goes out in search of that completeness or of that truth, God, or whatever name you like to give to it. To me, the very search is inherently not true. To me, a person who seeks truth, who sets out in search of truth, will never find it, because his search for truth, for that completeness, will be born out of an opposite. So, when we seek truth, we are seeking that understanding or that completeness away from that which we are. If we are in conflict, if we are in great sorrow, or if we are aware of tremendous emptiness, we naturally seek its opposite and call that as an end, as a finality, as truth, as God. So, our search for truth can only be born out of the opposite. Therefore, the thing that we discover in our search can never be true and yet all of us are longing all the time, are struggling to attain truth, to find out what truth is. To me, a man who seeks truth and the man who explains and describes truth are both false. The one is seeking truth out of an opposite, and the other who describes it, who says, “I know,” are both caught up in illusion. The man who says, “I know” must be limited. So, beware of a person who says he knows, because truth is not a thing to be known; it is. They are two different things: one is objective perception, and the other is inherently by itself, alone.</p>
<p>So, why are we continually caught up in the struggle, in the search for truth? I think it is because we hope that in realizing this truth, this completeness, this God, all our difficulties will be dissolved; or because our difficulties are so great, our problems so innumerable that we try to escape, run away to something that we conceive to be true. For the majority of people, the search for truth is but an escape, and action born out of this escape, born with the desire to seek truth, can give no comprehension. In that there is no significance, in that there is no fullness. We are out to seek God, we are out to find what truth is. In that desire to find out, we act. To me, that desire is born out of fear, out of desire to escape from our innumerable difficulties. Therefore, our action, our daily living, our thoughts, our emotion, our earning money - all these have no inherent value, because our action has a motive: the desire to gain, the desire to achieve, to realize truth; and we act from that craving. Therefore, action itself has lost its significance. If you are kind to me because I give you something in return, then surely your kindness has no meaning, because you are looking for a reward.</p>
<p>Now, in the same way, we seek out truth and act from that search. Our action has no meaning, because we rely for the understanding of action on a result; we look to the effect of action rather than to action itself. Our action then is judged by the effect, by the sensation, by praise from others, and its success. So, action inherently loses its value, because we are all the time looking to a result, to a reward. In our search which is born out of fear, out of escape, out of search for a solution, our action loses its own intrinsic significance. Only in action itself lies the whole of eternity.</p>
<p>If we become aware that we are acting in this way, then we do not seek truth through action, but in action itself. To me, action is awareness in that which you are doing. When you are aware, the past memories, past hindrances, past things that you have not fully comprehended, come into activity, without your trying to analyze the subconscious. That is true awareness. While you are acting, if you are fully conscious of all its significance, in that lies the true understanding of that action.</p>
<p>Now we look through action to gain something. We say, through self-discipline we shall find truth; through righteous acts we shall realize completeness; through loving, through service, we shall realize God. So service, love, kindliness, righteousness - which we call action - all be their significance because we are all the time looking for a reward at the other end.</p>
<p>When you become aware of this, when you understand it, not only intellectually, but emotionally as well, when you feel it, the futility of such an act, and when you become so aware, then while you are acting in everyday things, all the past memories, hindrances, will come into activity, and thereby, you will be free without analyzing. Where there is self-analysis there is death to action. The more and more you analyze, the less and less you will ever act naturally, fully, spontaneously. In this self-analysis there is greater and greater effort, and therefore a limitation of action. In such action there is always the observer, the watcher and the thing that acts, and in such action there is always a duality.</p>
<p>In action born of self-analysis there is no harmony, no completeness. Such action can never give you its full significance. Whereas, if you are fully aware in action, which to me is true action, then in that flame all your past hindrances, your memories, your lack of comprehension, comes into full being and you free your mind from that limitation.</p>
<p>To understand what I am saying, you will have to experiment. I have heard so many people say to me, “What you are saying is not practical, has no use.” First of all, to find out if it is practical, you have to experiment with it; you have to try it. Then, when you try to understand what I am saying, you will say, “What you are saying is very complicated, I cannot understand it.”</p>
<p>Now, this is what I am saying. I am going to try and make it as simple as I can. Our action has always a motive. Our action is born of a reaction, out of a memory, out of a search for reward, achievement or truth, or for the love of another, or the love of one’s country, etc. I say that such action born of conformity, of authority, cannot give you its full significance, in which alone lies the whole of eternity. And as the actions of most people are based on that, I say, do not therefore go to the opposite and say, “I must find out from what I am reacting.” Do not say, “I must act from myself alone, not from reaction.”</p>
<p>I say: Become conscious, become aware in your action that you are acting in search of reward. That is very simple, is it not? Become fully aware in your action, that you are acting through a desire for a reward, achievement, success, or through fear, through escape. The moment you have become fully conscious of that, the cause disappears because you will have understood it. You can only do that when your mind and heart are fully occupied, are fully harmonious with that act.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>If there is harmony between mind and heart in action, where does will come in?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The questioner wants to know, “If action is born out of the harmony of mind and heart, where does will come in?” Now, what do you mean by will? Is it not the exertion or the effort to overcome, conquer? Will is the very center of effort, effort directed with the desire to be consistent, effort with regard to conquering. So that when there is a conflict there must be effort, and out of conflict there is born will, a resistance to overcome that conflict. To put it differently, where there is conflict, there is a consciousness of the ‘I’. The ‘I’ is identified with self-consciousness, with will. So, will is synonymous with that self-consciousness, that conflict.</p>
<p>Why is there conflict? Why is each one of us in conflict? I think because we have in our minds this idea of continual progress, endeavor, a ceaseless series of achievements, that perfection lies not at right angles to these innumerable steps towards perfection. We think that perfection lies at the end of a series of achievements, successes. To me perfection lies at right angles to that idea.</p>
<p>Conflict arises also because we are lonely, because we are conscious of that insufficiency, and we try, through choice, to fill up that insufficiency. So where there is choice, there must be effort and hence there must be will. We hope through choice to discern. We hope that by choosing this against that we will have learned, our mind will have grown bigger, our heart more expanded, that we will be nearer perfection through our choice. To me, discernment is impossible through choice. To put it differently, through will you cannot discern, through will you cannot comprehend, because will is created through resistance.</p>
<p>We want character, we want virtue, and to develop character and to possess virtue there must be effort. Whereas to me, a man of character, a man of will, can never understand the full freedom of life, because his character, his will, is based on resistance. Please, if I am using the wrong word, pass through the words.</p>
<p>Will is developed through distinction. In distinction there is no comprehension. Distinction creates resistance. Distinction, which is choice, must create resistance, and out of that resistance there is the consciousness of will. It is like damming up a river. There is a swirl, strong movement, a whirlpool of water. Then that dam is removed, there is a free flow of water. To me, that dam represents the struggle for virtue, this constant development of character. This continual struggle to choose is but a resistance born of distinction.</p>
<p>So I say: Do not choose, but discern. Discernment does not lie between two choices, between this and that, but is the freedom of both. When you have to decide between two things, what do you do? You calculate, you weigh, so you are merely looking at the opposites. Whereas, what happens when you have to decide something vital, something immense, which demands your whole concentration, your whole interest? You do not calculate, you do not weigh. Your thought and your emotions act right together and there comes out of that a true discernment.</p>
<p>This is what happens in every case when you have to do something vital. You do not choose, you act with a full heart. That is what you call intuition. I purposely do not use that word, because from my point of view, it has been so much misrepresented. So, in the development of will you create a further resistance, and therefore further distinction, and hence, a greater conflict of choice. Your struggle is infinite, your endeavor is continual.</p>
<p>When you are acting naturally, spontaneously, easily, there is no will. You are acting from that fullness; in that there is no will. You have not to make an effort, you have not to control, to discipline, you have not to re strict, you have not to choose - you act. It is only when there is self-consciousness which is the result of conflict, the result of resistance born of distinction, that will comes into being.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>For people who are not able to protect themselves from complete abasement such as feeblemindedness, victims of their passions, morphinists, etc., is it not to be regarded rather as a help to belong to a religion, sect, or the like?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Look here, friends. If you are such people, you must have a drug. Then you must have religion, you must have sects. If you are babies, you must have nurses, and the nurses will keep you as babies. You say, “I am not feebleminded and not a victim to my passion, but someone else is. Is it not necessary for him?”</p>
<p>Why do you consider him? Are you afraid of him? Are you acting out of pity, compassion for him? You say, “I will give him what is necessary for him - a religion, a sect, and the like.” You adopt a superior attitude, what you call a considerate attitude, and give him a religion, and say, “Is it not necessary for him?” So you keep him, by your giving him a drug, you keep him as feebleminded as ever. That is the attitude always of class distinctions. The man who says, “I will give you what is necessary,” keeps you always at that level below him, keeps that distinction. This has always been so throughout the ages; the man who has knowledge treats the other as being an imbecile, and gives him what is necessary and keeps him there.</p>
<p>Or we go the other way. We say, “I will awaken that man below to a higher attitude,” which is another form of pity. To me, if a sect, a religion, is a limitation for you, it is a limitation for everybody. If, as I hold, there cannot be a mediator between truth and yourself, then a priest is unnecessary for you, as well as for the feebleminded man.</p>
<p>You see, we want people to awaken to a certain result, to a certain image, to a certain pattern. We do not want people to be awake and let them find out, but we want them to he awakened to a particular point of view. For me, the importance is not religions and sects and all the rest of it, but to awaken him to the cause of these things. When he becomes awake for himself, then he will break away from the cause instead of your giving him a panacea, of your giving him the opiate that will, you hope, awaken him; it does not.</p>
<p>This same thing applies to self-discipline, to everything. So the proper question is: Do you need it? Do you need religion, sects, self-discipline, imposition of authority to keep you straight, to make you behave, so that your acts shall be righteous? That is the way I would put the question. Do I need it, not someone else? And in freeing myself from that prison, I will not only break down my own walls, but I will help another to break down his too. Make him realize the cause, not help him to break down the walls, because he will build another wall if you merely help him to destroy the wall.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You mention discernment as an act of pure intuition. What is pure intuition and how can one know that it is pure, true?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As I said: discernment is choiceless. Think about it. So long as the mind is caught up in choice, there cannot be direct perception of what is true, because choice is based on like and dislike, on want; and all want blinds. Now, an action born of such a want, such a choice, must create conflict; and one can only time conscious of that conflict, not of what is true intuition. When you ask me to explain what true intuition is, I say: You will know it when your action is free of choice.</p>
<p>We are so little accustomed to act easily, without conflict. We are so frightened, because we have acted, and the consequences have been so disastrous, so painful. So we go about trying to find out what is true action, what is pure intuition, so that we can grasp it intellectually and mold our minds and hearts to that effect. When we realize, when we become fully aware that our very actions are born of this escape, this fear, when we really feel that, then out of that there comes a natural action in which there is no conflict.</p>
<p>Most of our intuition is based on sensation. We like an idea, it gives us satisfaction, pleasure, contentment, and we say, “It is an intuitive idea,” and we cling to it, because we want that idea. Therefore, it is no longer a pure idea, a pure thing in itself. It happens so often that one hears of the idea of reincarnation, and you jump at it and say, “It is an intuitive idea, I feel it is true, it must be so”; and you call that an intuitive idea or intuition. It is not at all intuition. It is because you want this idea of reincarnation, because you feel satisfaction, comfort, postponement of your discernment in the present, and it encourages you to cling to that idea.</p>
<p>We are not discussing whether reincarnation is a fact or not. We will go into that another time. That is of very little importance. As long as there is a want, a desire for comfort, security, then there can be no intuition, no true intuition, so do not inquire what is intuition, so long as you are caught up in it. Become aware that you are caught up in it and free yourself, and in that act there is intuition; such an act is born of intuition. You may think what I am saying is a negative way of approaching life. It is not. What you have been doing is to me a negative way of living, establishing a picture and living according to that, which you call a positive way of living, which is but an escape.</p>
<p>The same thing is implied in this question: “What is intuition? How shall one know when it is pure?” You will know when it is pure when there are no conflicts, when there is full reason behind it as well as feeling. But to have such action born of that intuition your mind and heart must be entirely free from fear, achievement, success, and all the rest of it. So look to that first and not to what is intuition.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>I am in disharmony with my thoughts, feelings, actions, and therefore dissatisfied. The reason is, there is no understanding between my husband and myself, but I cannot go away from him because he is ill. What is your advice, so that I may come to a better understanding?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First of all, we cling to people because we ourselves are empty. We hope the other will enrich us. That is the reason why we possess people. So that creates disharmony also. Now, that is one side.</p>
<p>The questioner wants to know what she shall do, because she is dissatisfied, living with that person, the husband. Either you are relying on him for your sufficiency, which he does not supply, which makes you feel dissatisfied, or you want to give to him and he will not accept, and therefore you are still dissatisfied. Or, you do not like him, so you feel dissatisfied.</p>
<p>If you think about those three points, then the question will be answered. I do not advise what you shall do. You know, we rely on each other for our strength, for our completeness: husband and wife, brothers and sisters, etc. When that is not supplied, we feel utterly at a loss and we become thoroughly dissatisfied. We look to another for our completion, we look to another for love, for encouragement, because we are lonely. We turn to the other and we increase that loneliness. That loneliness becomes deeper and deeper, only we are trying to run away from it.</p>
<p>So when you realize that, when you really become aware that no one can fulfill you, can give you full completeness, except through your own comprehension, then you put up with minor details as having a husband ill in bed. Then the problem does not arise. The question, choice, of whether to stay or leave does not arise. Please think it over.</p>
<p>Choice arises - as in this case, what you should do - when you feel your husband, your brother, etc. cannot give you that fullness. Therefore you say, “To whom shall I turn? Another man or another woman?” in the hope that another shall give you, instead of the one that you have already. Whereas, if you realize fully - not mentally agree, not intellectually - if you really feel and think that it is utterly impossible for anyone to complete you, then you will act, irrespective of circumstances.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Is impersonal love possible while sex forces are still driving one into bonds of love which, however highly tuned, are still personal? How far are you in favor of recommending to guide those forces into higher centers by means of occult practices?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Life is creative energy. It is the mind that splits it up as mental, emotional, and sexual, and because you are caught up in passion, lust, you have divided it, and you want to transmute it somehow or other through practices. Because you do not live a complete life, there is a strong passion which dominates. I say, if you live completely, there will not be this conflict of emotion, sex, mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>How far are you in favor of recommending to guide those forces to higher centers by means of occult practices?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You know, we think by practices, by doing a thing over and over again, we are gaining something. I do not believe in practices. I think they are detrimental. Please do not say, “Must I not practice a piano?” What you call occult practices is to instill in your mind a certain set of ideas which you repeat, which you practice, so that this thing, against which you are fighting, is gradually submerged, suppressed, and you think you have transmuted sex to a higher plane. Sex is sex, you cannot transmute it. But you can be either caught in that energy, which becomes devastating, or you live in that energy so wholly that your acts are complete. This you have to think over very carefully. Please do not say, “I feel sexual, therefore I am going to live completely in it.” Because our minds and hearts are so little awakened, so little ripe, mature, we take delight in passion. That fills our minds and our hearts. The whole of modern civilization is built on it, on sensation, because we are so little, and we hope through practices to conquer that littleness, which exists in our mind and our heart, and thereby transmute our sex to a higher plane.</p>
<p>So long as the mind and the heart are caught up in little things, then you will have all these sexual problems. If mind and heart are rich, full, great, then these things will have secondary importance. If you are truly creative by acting as a complete human being, then this problem does not arise; then there is no problem. It is only when the mind and heart are divided in action against themselves that there is a problem, and to overcome that division, you want to practice. How absurd! That way you make your mind smaller and smaller, your heart becomes less and less through these continual practices. So, to really understand and be free, find out if your mind and heart are crippled with conformity. Where there is conformity, there will be no release of life. There is conformity so long as you are seeking a reward, an achievement, the setting-up of authority, and hence the limitation, the curtailment of freedom.</p>
<p>So long as there is limitation of mind and heart, all these other problems will exist, and if you are seeking a solution when you say “transmuting,” that is what you are doing: seeking a solution, a way out, an escape, you are merely limiting that creative energy, which is thought, feeling, and everything - your whole being.</p>
