<p>It would be an orderly and peaceful world if there were neither the teacher, the guru, nor the disciple. Have you ever considered why there must be a guru and a disciple? Why do you have to look to another for guidance, for enlightenment? The desire to gain, to acquire, breeds conflict and misery; this desire for profit, whether spiritual or in this world, breeds antagonism between man and man. If we can understand together this struggle for gain, we shall find peace, and the division between the teacher and the disciple will cease; the fear, called love and respect, between the master and pupil will disappear if we cease to think in terms of becoming.</p>
<p>Being caught in the process of becoming, of acquisition, and realizing its strife and pain, the desire to get out of it gives birth to the conflict of duality. Gain always engenders fear, and fear gives birth to the conflict of opposites - the overcoming of what is and transforming it into that which is desired. Does not an opposite contain the germ of its own opposite? Is virtue the opposite of vice? If it is, then it ceases to be virtue. If virtue is the opposite of vice, then virtue is the outcome of vice. Beauty is not the denial of the ugly. Virtue has no opposite. Greed can never become nongreed, any more than ignorance can become enlightenment. If enlightenment is the opposite of ignorance, then it is no longer enlightenment. Greed is still greed when it tries to become nongreed, for the becoming itself is greed. The conflict of the opposites is not the conflict of dissimilars, but of changing and opposing desires. Conflict exists only when what is is not understood. If we can understand what is, then there is no conflict of its opposite. What is can be understood only through choiceless awareness in which there is neither condemnation, justification, nor identification.</p>
<p>Questioner: You have often talked of relationship. What does it mean to you?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: There can be no existence in isolation. To be is to be related, and without relationship there is no existence. Relationship is challenge and response. The relationship of one with another is society; society is not independent of you; the mass is not a separate entity by itself, but is the product of you and your relationship with another, the group. Relationship is the awareness of interaction between you and another. Now, what is this relationship based on? You say it is based on interdependence, mutual assistance, and so on, but apart from the emotional screen which we throw up against each other, what is it actually founded on? On mutual gratification, is it not? If I do not please you, you get rid of me in different ways, and if I please you, you accept me as your wife, your neighbor, or as your friend or guru. This is the actual fact, is it not? Relationship is sought where there is mutual gratification, satisfaction, and when you do not find it or it is not given to you, you change your relationship, you seek a divorce, or, putting up with what is, you try to find gratification elsewhere. You change your guru, your teacher, or join another organization. You move from one relationship to another until you find what you seek, which is gratification, security, comfort, and so on. When you seek gratification in relationship, there is always bound to be conflict. When in relationship security is sought, which is ever evasive, there is the struggle to possess, to dominate, and the pain of jealousy, of uncertainty. Self-assertive demands, possessiveness, the desire for psychological security and comfort, deny love. You may talk about love as responsibility, as duty, and so on, but actually there is no love, which can be seen in the structure of modern society. The manner in which you treat your husbands and wives, your children, neighbors, friends, is an indication of the lack of love in relationship. What then is the significance of relationship? If you observe yourself in relationship, do you not find that it is a process of self-revelation? Does not your contact with another reveal, if you are aware, your own state of being? Relationship is a process of self-revelation, of self-knowledge. Since it reveals unpleasant, disquieting thoughts and actions, there is a flight from such relationship into a comforting and soothing one. Relationship becomes of very little significance when it is based on mutual gratification, but it becomes very significant when it is self-revealing.</p>
<p>Love has no relationship. It is only when the other becomes more important, then begins relationship of pleasure and pain. When you give yourself over utterly and wholly, when you love, then there is no relationship - relationship as mutual gratification or as a process of self-revelation. There is no gratification in love. Such love is a marvelous thing. In it there is no friction but a state of complete integration, of ecstatic being. There are such moments, such rare, happy, joyous moments when there is love, complete communion. Love recedes when the object of love becomes more important; then the conflict of possession, of fear, of jealousy begins and so love recedes, and the further it recedes, the greater the problem of relationship becomes, losing its worth, its meaning. Love cannot be brought into being through discipline, through any means, through any intellectual urgency. It is a state of being which comes when the activities of the self have ceased. These activities must not be disciplined away, suppressed, or shunned, but understood. There must be an awareness, and so an understanding, of the activities of the self, in all its different layers.</p>
<p>We do have these rare moments of love when there is no thought, no motive, and because they are rare, we cling to them ever hopefully, but this memory is a barrier to the living reality of love. To understand relationship it is important to be aware of what is actually taking place, in all its subtle forms, and this will bring about self-knowledge, it will reveal the activities of the self. Because you do not desire to be revealed to yourself - that you are seeking gratification and hiding yourself in comfort - relationship loses its significance, its depth, and its beauty. Love comes into being only when there is self-forgetfulness, that communion with reality.</p>
<p>Questioner: The Theosophical Society announced you to be the Messiah and World Teacher. Why did you leave the Society and renounce the Messiahship?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Let us examine the question of organizations. There is rather a nice story of a man who was walking along a street and behind him two strangers were following. As he walked along, he saw something very bright, picked it up and put it in his pocket. The two strangers observed his action, and one said to the other, ''This is a very bad business for you, isn't it?'' The other, who was the Devil, replied, ''No, though he picked up truth, I am going to help him organize it.'' Can truth be organized, or through any organization can you find it? Must you not go beyond and above all organization and beliefs to discover truth? Why do these so-called spiritual organizations, churches, exist? They are built around beliefs, dogmas, and so on, are they not? Beliefs and organizations are ever separating people, keeping people apart, as the Hindu and Muslim, as the Buddhist and the Christian. Belief, in any form, political or religious, throws up a barrier between man and man, inevitably bringing conflict and misery. Though the adherents of organizations and beliefs talk of brotherhood and love, they are the very people who will encourage and connive at the destruction of others.</p>
<p>Are such organizations necessary? You understand what I mean by organizations? I am referring to the psychological, so-called spiritual, religious organizations. Are they necessary? They exist on the supposition that they will help man to realize truth or God or what you will. They exist for propagandistic purposes, for conversion, for increase of membership, and so on; you want to tell others what you think or what you have learned or what appears to be the true. And can truth be propagated? If truth is propagated it ceases to be the true. Truth is to be experienced not according to any belief or pattern, and if experience is organized it ceases to be the true, it becomes a lie, so a hindrance to reality. The real, the immeasurable, cannot be formulated, the unknown cannot be measured by the known. When you measure it, it ceases to be the true; it is a lie and only a lie can be propagated. Organizations that are supposed to be based on the search for the real, when they become propagandists' instruments, they cease to be of any significance; not only the organization to which the questioner refers, but all so-called spiritual organizations become the means of exploitation. Such organizations become like any other business corporation, with buildings, investments, which become all-important. Truth is not to be found through any organization; truth comes into being when there is freedom. Belief in any form is the craving for security, and he who is seeking security cannot discover truth.</p>
<p>Whether I am a Messiah or not can be answered simply: I have never denied it and I do not think it matters very much what I think about it. What is important is to find out for yourself if my teachings are the truth. Do not judge by labels, do not give importance to the name; and whether I am the World Teacher or the Messiah or something else is of the least significance to you. If the name has become important, then you will miss the truth. One will assert that I am, and another that I am not, but your conflict, confusion, and sorrow are not solved by any of these assertions and denials. It is important, very important, to be earnest after the search of truth, for it gives freedom from strife and pain. The truth of my teachings can be discovered in your daily life, and truth is not distant but very near. The intellectual will not find it for he is caught in the net of his own knowledge which prevents his understanding; the man of devotion will not find it for he is caught in the confusion of his own image and emotion. He who is earnest will understand it.</p>
<p>Questioner: On two or three occasions during the course of the talks I have attended, I have become conscious, if I may venture to describe the experience, of standing in the presence of one vast void of utter silence and solitude for a fraction of a second. It feels as though I am at the entrance but dare not step into it. What feeling is this, please? Is it some hallucination, self-suggestion in the present stormy, turbulent conditions in which our daily life is passed?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: During these talks and discussions there have been moments when we felt deeply and understood profoundly, when we perceived for ourselves certain states of consciousness, and since we pushed it to a point of great understanding and depth, there was stillness and absolute silence. But when this immeasurable tranquillity is willed or induced, then it is the product of hallucination, of self-hypnosis; if you yourself, during the course of these discussions and discourses, have not been aware and pursued your own thoughts and feelings ever deeper, and understood them fully and so experienced directly for yourself, then the void of utter silence and solitude become fascinating escapes from the turmoil and pain of existence. There is always the danger of being influenced by another for good and for bad. The indication that you can be influenced is significant; if you can be influenced for the good, you can also be influenced for the bad. War, racial hatred, and so on are examples. The problem is not how to enter this silence, this creative state of being, but whether it has come into being through understanding or through persuasion and influence, through your own careful and wise search, or through craving. If this void of silence has come to you through your own understanding, then it has great significance; if it is merely intellectual or verbal, then it has no significance whatsoever. There is no intellectual understanding; there is understanding when the whole being is alert; there is no partial or intellectual understanding. You understand or you do not understand; partial understanding has no meaning.</p>
<p>Passive awareness brings about the cessation of conflict, and when the mind is no longer creating, there is tranquillity, utter silence. You cannot enter it if there is fear. It must come to you uninduced, uninvited; if you attempt to go to it, then you already know it, and what is known is not the real. If you strive after it, you have already formulated it, and so it is not the real. Reality must come to you, you cannot go towards it. All great things come to you. Love must come, but if you pursue it, it will ever evade. If you are open, undemanding, still, then it comes.</p>
<p>The question of influence is of significance. We desire to be influenced, we want to be encouraged, we crave for security in another. Being confused, we seek the sanction of authority. There lies the danger - to look to another for deliverance, for understanding. Freedom cannot be given by another, salvation is not found through another, no matter who he is. Understanding comes when the mind is single, free, not distracted by effort. You must give your whole being to understand what is; in this complete surrender to what is, there comes absolute silence. In the void the real is.</p>
<p>Questioner: You have said that a mind in bondage is vagrant, restless, disorderly. Will you please explain further what you mean?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Have you not noticed that a mind held in bondage to an idea, to a problem, is always restless? It is ever seeking an answer, ever seeking to guard the idea, the belief, so it is ever apprehensive, disorderly. A mind in prison, conscious or unconscious, is ever seeking freedom and so ever vagrant. But if the mind is aware of its own prison, of its self-created bondage, then it is pursuing the truth of the bondage and not wandering away from the problem itself. The problem is the mind itself and not the problem the mind fabricates. When you are conscious of a problem, the response is to be free of it, to solve it, to run away from it; this very striving indicates restlessness, disorder. If there were no interest in the search for an answer to the problem but interest in the understanding of the problem itself - in which alone is the answer - then the mind, being free from the search for an answer, for an escape, and so being concentrated, whole, would be capable of pursuing swiftly every movement of the problem; as the problem is ever new, ever undergoing a modification, the mind must also be fresh, unhampered by belief, by conclusion, by conviction, by theory.</p>
<p>For the mind to free itself from creating problems is meditation. Meditation is not mere repetition of words, mantras, japas, chants, or sitting in front of a picture or image, made by the hand or by the mind. Meditation is not prayer or concentration. Meditation is thought freeing itself from time; through the process of time, the timeless cannot be comprehended, and as the mind is the product of time, thought must cease for the real to be. Thought is the product of time, the experience of yesterday; thought is caught in the net of time and so it cannot understand the timeless, the eternal.</p>
<p>The problem then is for the mind to free itself from time. Whatever it formulates, whatever it creates is of time, whether it be the paramatma, the super-soul, or the Brahma, and so on, it is still of time. Meditation is the freeing of thought from time; meditation is the ending of thought.</p>
<p>Is it not extremely arduous for thought to end itself? No sooner does one thought come into being before another sweeps it aside, so thought is never completed. Meditation is completing thought, ending thought by thinking right through, for in ending there is renewal. How can thought complete itself? For, that which is complete has no continuity. Thought can come to an end only when the thinker understands himself. The thinker and his thought are not two separate processes but one. The thinker is the thought, but the thinker separates himself from his thought for his permanency, for his continuance. Take away the thoughts of the thinker and the thinker is not. Remove the qualities of the 'me', the self, his name, his property, his idiosyncrasies, his memories, and the thinker is not. To complete every thought that arises, whether they are so-called good or so-called bad, is extremely arduous, for it involves the slowing down of the mind. A motor of high speed cannot be observed. It must be slowed down to study its parts. For the mind to understand itself, it must slow down.</p>
<p>To bring order to the confused, disorderly, vagrant mind, follow each thought through. To follow each thought, put it down on paper, write down some thoughts as they arise. As most minds are vagrant, full of thoughts that seem so disconnected, order and clarity can be brought about when each thought is completed. As you are listening to me, you are following a thought through, you are following the thoughts that are being put forward. Your thoughts are not wandering, and as what I am saying is not mere intellection but an actual experience, you are following intently, which indicates that you can slow down your thoughts so as to follow one thought through. In writing down thoughts as they arise, you will soon be conscious of your condemnations, identifications, prejudices, and so on. From this there arises choiceless awareness which will free consciousness from its accumulations. A consciousness that is filled with every kind of memory, racial prejudice, national demands, religious and psychological apprehensions, can never be still. As thought frees itself from time, it will not be possible to indulge in certain activities.</p>
<p>The other day a man came to see me. He wanted to find peace, find what he called God. He stated that he was a speculator. He can never have peace, for he is indulging in activities that are not peaceful. You, too, want peace and happiness, love and joy, but you indulge in those activities that are not peaceful, that are vicious, caught in those professions that are destructive, as the army, the police, and the law. Thought, in understanding its own process, will bring about a crisis in its daily activities. You do not have to wait for a crisis which will demand direct action. Thus, in bringing about clarification, there comes joy and peace. As the pool becomes still when the breezes stop, so when the self-created problems come to an end, there is tranquillity, silence, a silence that is not induced nor compelled. In this silence that which is unutterable comes into being.</p>
<p>Questioner: Does not the belief in reincarnation explain inequality in society?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: What a callous way of resolving a problem! Does the problem of inequality cease because you have a belief? You may not explain away suffering according to your belief, for suffering continues, there is still inequality. You believe according to the dictates of your gratification, and belief is not a solution to the pain of division. Is inequality, with its fears, explained away by theories, either of the right or of the left, whether it is an economic or religious belief? The theories of the extreme left or of the modified left or of the right surely do not do away with inequality, which is not based on the sensate but on psychological values. Because you believe in reincarnation - a progressive becoming a little higher and more virtuous than the other fellow - you feel gratified and rewarded; because you are economically or socially better off, or because you have suffered and worked in the past, in the past life, you feel a little superior and the other fellow a little bit below you, who in turn will come up the ladder of achievement, so there will always be those above and those below. Surely, this is a most odd way of dealing with life, is it not? The most brutal and callous way of dealing with one of the problems of life, is it not? You want explanations and explanations apparently satisfy you, whether they are of the right or of the left.</p>
<p>Reincarnation, or the belief in it, is not a solvent of the problems of life, is it? Such beliefs help to postpone understanding, which is ever in the present. The fact of inequality - the untouchable, the Brahmin and the nonBrahmin, the callous commissar and the poor fellow who works way down below him - the fact of division and pain remains, and no explanations, however scientific and beautiful, intellectual or romantic, will wipe it away. Those above and often those below seem to be satisfied with words and more words. How is this inequality to be eliminated? Can it be wiped away by any system, economic or religious? Can a system, either of the left or of the right, do away with the actual fact that man likes to divide himself as the superior and the inferior? Bloody revolutions have not produced equality, though in their beginning they tried to maintain freedom and equality, but when the revolution is over, when the froth and excitement have subsided, again there is inequality - the boss, the tyrant, the dictator, and all the rest of the ugly business of existence. No government, no theory can wipe out the craving of man to be superior, to dominate; and to look to a theory, to a belief, is to be stupid, to be callous.</p>
<p>You look to a system, to a belief when your hearts are dry, when you have no love; then systems become all-important. When there is love, there is no division as the high and the low; then there is neither the prostitute nor the righteous. For the man caught up in righteousness, there is the brutality of division. Belief or system is not the solvent of our problems; you may, perhaps, build a society in which there is complete economic freedom, but as long as the psychological urge to be superior, to achieve, exists, there will be inequality, wiping away the economic structure, however carefully built. The only true and lasting solvent to your problems is love, kindliness, generosity, mercy. To love, to be merciful is not easy, and a man who is caught up in competition, in ruthless activities, who is pursuing gratification and achievement - to him explanations, beliefs, theories are very comforting. He can pursue his ugly ways and yet feel righteous.</p>
<p>Belief is not a substitution for love, and because you do not know love, you indulge in theories and in the search of systems that promise relief. This verbal pursuit is the most stupid activity. When you love there is neither the bright intellectual nor the wearying dull, neither the sinner nor the righteous, neither the rich nor the poor. It is a marvelous thing to be so free, and only love can give it. Love is possible only when beliefs, conclusions, theories, convictions, drop away. Love is possible only when you are human, not mechanical. How little we love in our daily life! You do not love your children, your wives, or your husbands, for you do not know them, you do not know yourself. Through self-knowledge there is love, and it is only love that resolves the human difficulties. Be simple, put away your aggressiveness, your competitive and greedy pursuits, and you will know love. He who loves is not concerned with the superior or the inferior, with the Master and the disciple. He who is content with what is has understanding; he has happiness and love.</p>
<p>Questioner: I have made the rounds of various teachers, gurus, and I would like to know from you what is the purpose of life.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Ladies do a great deal of window shopping, in Europe and in America, going from one shop window to another, looking from the outside at the dresses and wishing they had money to buy, or being content with the excitement of seeing so many things. Similarly, there seem to be many who indulge in this peculiar game of pleasure and excitement of going from guru to guru, always window shopping. What happens to such people? They are so often emotionally stretched that elasticity is lost. This artificial stimulation soon dulls feeling and its quick response and pliability are gone. Why do you go to a guru, to a teacher? Obviously for self-protection, for comfort, for direction, and where do you find it always? With a guru who gratifies you, with the teacher who gives you comfort. If the teacher tells you to abandon the ways of the world, to be simple, to love and be merciful, you will not go to him. If he gratifies you in that which you crave, then you fall at his feet. This game is for children, for the stupid, not for grown-ups, mature men. Again, if you feel comfortable, peaceful in the presence of the teacher, you become his devotee; this devotion is corruption, unworthy of the thoughtful, the earnest. But if the teacher demands something beyond your miserable comforts and securities, you soon find another. This foolish pursuit of gurus makes the mind dull and the heart empty, their pristine vigor and vitality are lost. What has happened to all of you who have followed gurus? You have lost the beauty of sensitivity, the quickness and depth of mind and heart.</p>
<p>The questioner wants to know from me what the purpose of life is. Apparently, he must have been told the purpose of life by the various teachers he has been to, and now he wants to collect mine; probably to choose among his collection the best and most gratifying. Sirs, this is all so infantile, so immature. The questioner, anonymous, explains in his letter that he is a married man, the father of several children, and is most anxious to be informed of the purpose of life. See the tragedy of it and do not laugh. You are all in the same position, are you not? You beget children, you are in responsible positions and yet you are immature in thought, in life. You do not know love. How shall you find out the purpose of life? Shall another tell you? Must you not discover it for yourself? Is the purpose of life the routine of office work, year after year? Is it the pursuit of money, of position and power? Is it the achievement of an ambition? Is it the performance of rituals, those vain repetitions? Is it the acquisition of virtue, to be walled in by barren righteousness? Surely none of these is the end purpose of life; then what is? To find it, must you not go beyond all these? Only then will you find it.</p>
<p>The man of sorrow is not seeking the purpose of life, he wants to be free from sorrow. But, you see, you are not aware that you suffer. You suffer, but escape from it, and so do not understand it. This question should reveal to you the ways of your mind and heart. The question is a self-revelation. You are in conflict, in confusion, in misery, which is the result of your own daily activities of thought and feeling. To understand this conflict, confusion, and misery, you have to understand yourself, and as you understand, thought proceeds deeper and deeper until the end purpose is revealed. But to merely stand on the edge of confusion and ask the meaning of life has no meaning. A man who has lost the song of his heart, he is ever seeking, he is enchanted by the voice of others. He will find it again only when he ceases to follow, when his desire is still.</p>
