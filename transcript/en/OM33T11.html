<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Memory, according to you, gives vitality to the creator of illusion, the ego, the ‘I’ consciousness, the bundle of hindrances. So, pure action can never spring from this memory.</p>
<p><i>Is spontaneous recollection of past incidents a hindrance, even though we do not allow our action to spring from that recollection? Freed from this memory, how can we normally adjust our relations with individuals? Is it not almost impossible in life?</i></p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You have understood the question? I have explained what I mean by memory, i.e. an ill-digested experience or an incident which you do not meet completely, wholly, leaves a scratch in the mind, which we call a memory. Now, with that memory we try to meet life, and that memory gives vitality because it creates hindrances. If I had a memory of an experience, which is an experience which I have not completely understood, that memory creates a further hindrance, because that prevents me from meeting experience fully.</p>
<p>Most of us have such memories - many such memories - which you call recollection, with which we try to meet experiences. Naturally, when you meet that recollection with memory, a person, an incident or an experience, you do not meet fully; therefore, you are further increasing the burden. Now, if you meet every person, experience, anew, with a free mind, with an awakened full mind, you will meet them with an adaptability, not with a fixation of mind. Memory gives us a rigidity so that, when you have many recollections, that rigidity becomes so strong that when you meet a person, or an experience, you do not fully comprehend it. Therefore, that recollection impedes you; whereas, if you meet every person or every experience free from that rigidity, which is memory, then in that there is a pliability, there is an adjustment, not a cunningness of mind which tries to get beyond a person or beyond an experience.</p>
<p>Let us say, someone has deceived me two years ago. That has left a memory, a recollection, and I meet that person again now. I meet him or her with that memory which is still in my mind. So, when I meet him, I am very cunning not to be deceived again, because I am suspicious and I do not want to be deceived, but my mind is so acute, cunning, that it is watching. Now, if you have nothing to give or nothing to receive, if you are not expecting something from that person, you can never be deceived.</p>
<p>Please, I am taking the principle, not the detail. You can apply the detail for yourself, when you think it over. If a person deceives you and you are hurt by that deception, that hurt is a memory, and that memory reacts later, when you meet that person again. Therefore, your mind has become more clever, more cunning, not more adaptable, more understanding; it has only become cleverer, more cunning, not to be caught in the same position again, and we think we have understood. We think our mind has become more cunning, and we know how to avoid being deceived the next time, and we think experience has taught us that. You have lent someone some money, and he does not return it, and the next time he comes, you think you have learned; your mind has become more cunning and you say, “Shall I give it to him or not?” I feel this is a wrong method of approach, a wrong way of doing things. Either give it to him and forget about it and not have this rigidity of mind or this prejudice, or, when you meet him next time, say, “Sorry, if I could give it to you I would, but I cannot.” Be quite open. Do not have a suspicious mind, a cunning mind, a rigid mind, but be frank. A frank mind is adaptable and therefore able to meet everything afresh, anew. Your mind is then so adjustable, so pliable, that when you meet this person again, there is something anew, not the same old suspicion brought for ward. But, as long as we do not meet persons or experiences of life completely, with all our mind and heart, there must be conflict, and that conflict creates memory. It is really very simple, when you have no conflict in your mind, there is no memory. You may remember an incident, I am not talking of that, but there is no attachment to that memory, which pursues you through time until you have completed that incident or that experience. We are living constantly in this conflict. That conflict creates memory, and the mind is filled with that memory and is identified with it, and so there is in that identification the idea of ‘I’ - which is conflict. There is a vast difference between the primitive man and the liberated man. The primitive man has no memory, because he acts immediately without thought; whereas the liberated man meets everything completely, because he has understanding. In him there is a richness, a fullness, and therefore through intelligence he is able to meet it. I hope I have answered that question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Is there a conformity every time that there is craving? Please explain fully.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is a craving for a definite thing and a craving for some indefinable thing. Take, for instance, when you desire, or crave, or long for happiness, truth, wealth, security, and other such things. In that there is conformity, because you have already pictured in your mind what you want, and you are going after it; you know what the end is and you want it, and your end is but an opposite in which you are again caught. So you are merely conforming to a mental image which you have created. In that there is imitation. So in one sense, where there is craving there must be conformity.</p>
<p>But there is the other type of wanting, which is more nebulous. You do not know what you want but there is something missing, something indefinable, impalpable, creating a void. Now, when you seek to fill up, to cover up, to run away from that void, it is also an imitation. First of all, why do we imitate? Please understand what I mean by imitation. There is imitation in art, in poetry, in culture, but I am not talking of that. To me, there can only be true action, complete action, when you as an individual are completely individual: when you as an individual have realized full aloneness. When I use that word <i>aloneness,</i> I mean by that a solitude - not a running away into a forest - which comes when you discover right values. When you find out what truth is, you are alone, that is, there is only that thing, that true value, and from that action comes. To know that action, that full action, you cannot have imitation; you cannot have any false values. So, where there is false value, there must be imitation, because false value creates want. And with the understanding of right values, there is freedom from want - not the putting away or the destroying of want, which you can never do. You can never destroy desire, because it creates such havoc, and this is what most so-called spiritual people are trying to do. Whereas, if they find out the right values, then they will act from that aloneness, from that solitude, and in that there is no imitation.</p>
<p>You can only discover right values through a complete action. Where there is false value, there must be craving, because it creates an impediment and therefore a want, an incompleteness, and therefore an intense desire for completeness, which is also another want. So where there is false value, there must be conflict, and that conflict creates a desire to escape, or to solve that particular conflict; and where there is a desire to solve or escape, there must be authority and imitation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Mentally I am fully convinced of the utter futility of something I want. But it is with me as you pointed out last week: my emotions do not yet reach the same point. Will you be so kind as to tell me once more how it is possible to have heart and mind fully balanced, harmonious?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why do you want it? What do you want me to tell you? You want to bring your emotions to the level of your mind. You want your emotions to grow or become more refined, more detached, and you want me to help you to grow. Now, as I explained the other day, a thing that is growing is not lasting. If your desire does not create such a great conflict in you with regard to something you want, then no amount of balancing will ever produce harmony. If your want does not create havoc in you, great discontent, you cannot artificially bring your heart and mind to a level with each other, to a balance. No amount of discussion or artificial stimulation will ever produce that harmony. But your desire, if it is strong, will create discontent, disharmony, and out of that disharmony comes the ecstasy of harmony.</p>
<p>You are afraid to be disharmonious. You have heard me talking about security, and the falseness of it. If you have listened, as I hope you have listened, for your own delight, it must have struck a deep understanding within you. From that there is a decision on your own part, and that means an act, and from that act you will find out whether your mind and heart are harmonious or not.</p>
<p>You say now, “Intellectually I do not want security, but emotionally I do want it. How am I to bring them together?” I say both are false. You want security. Do not say, “I understand intellectually the falseness of it, but emotionally I want it.” It shows you want security both mentally and emotionally, because, when you really understand a thing, you do not understand intellectually alone, you understand with your heart as well. So when you say, “I understand intellectually, mentally,” you mean you are inclined to agree with what I say, but there is no understanding in that. You see the advisability, the niceness of it, to be free of the worry of it, but you are not going to do anything about it. But, when you do do something about it, in that disturbance, you will know how to do it naturally. You do not really see the falseness of security, and therefore you say, “I have heard Krishnamurti and I think he may be right; therefore, I will try to be free from security.” That means that you do not understand the significance of freedom from security, the security of money, friends, ideas, authority, and imitation. There are infinite possibilities in that freedom, and infinite ecstasy. You do not see that, and yet you agree vaguely that you must do it because of benefiting society, for kindness, for nonexploitation, and so on. But it has not really awakened a decision, and no one can awaken that decision in you, except your own continual awakened interest in life or if you are thoroughly discontented, intelligently discontented.</p>
<p>So, do not try and bring mind and heart together, as that will be just another discipline. You see how subtle the mind is, how it comes back again and again to the old form of thought. You say, “We must not have discipline,” because you have heard me talk about it, but you are trying to do exactly the same thing when you aim at bringing mind and heart to balance. Do not do such an artificial thing! You only create a further distinction, increasing that observer, all the time dissecting action. But see if you really profoundly understand and agree, first! If you really think that one must be free from all conflict, with all its implications - if you really think about it and really feel about it, and agree - then your action is immediate, then your whole being responds instantaneously and there is discernment. Now, because you do not agree, you do not feel the immense necessity of it, you make this artificial distinction of mind and heart. To me, there is no distinction between mind and heart. If someone talks to me about the stupidity of imitation, and if I agree, there is an intense awareness in my action to see if that action is imitative. Then I shall know if my mind and heart are balanced. In the full recognition, not repetition or acquiescence, but in the full understanding of the idea of comfort or the freedom from authority, when you agree profoundly, then from that agreement there is action and in that action you will know. If that action is really harmonious, then your mind and heart are in perfect union. So do not seek to bring about a balance, but rather see if you really understand the falseness of authority, or security, or any of these ideas.</p>
<p>It is only in stirring up a muddy pool that you will know what is in that pool. Now we are only skimming over the surface of the waters, because we are afraid to disturb that superficial tranquility. And you can only disturb that pool, which is really stagnant water, by action, and that action should be born only out of full agreement. If you do not agree, carry on as you are. If you think you need comfort, carry on, but be fully aware that you need comfort, give your whole mind and heart to it, and in that fullness of desire for comfort you will find out its futility.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>How can man overcome the sorrow he has when he sees somebody suffering and not be able to help him? Is compassion a fault, or is it something necessary in social life?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>When you have compassion you don’t suffer. Compassion is like the scent of a flower. We suffer because we want a result, that is, when you say, “I am compassionate of the person who is suffering; I want him to get better.” In other words, you want a result for your compassion. Not that I do not want to see the person better himself, but personally I do everything I can to help him to get better, but there is no suffering in that. You suffer when there is possessive instinct. The many of you who are listening to me, if I am ill tomorrow, you would not suffer, because you do not possess me. But if I were your wife or your husband, then there would be suffering because I am yours. But compassion is free from sorrow because it is non-possessive.</p>
<p>You ask, “Is compassion a fault, or is it something necessary in social life?”</p>
<p>Why do you think certain things are necessary for social life? If you are a human being, the necessity of behaving in a certain manner disappears. Now we say, “These are necessary for right behavior in society.” If my actions, as I have been trying to explain, are complete, if I am truly a human being in its right sense, there are no demands or edicts which society can impose on me, because I am not fighting society, because I understand the values of society, with all its falseness and its truth. I am fully cognizant of everything. My point is, if you are truly complete in your action - which is not an impossibility; do not say it is only for the liberated, for the few - if your actions are complete, then you do not create a society which is opposed to you: you are not in conflict with society. That does not mean that you do not want to bring about a change and all the rest of it, but society does not impose itself on you with all its false values.</p>
<p>You ask “Is compassion a fault, or is it something necessary in social life?”</p>
<p>I object to the word <i>necessary.</i> That shows you are merely a cog in the social structure. That is what I am trying to say. I have finished about compassion, because there is very little to say about it. You cannot talk about such things. I am talking about this idea that certain actions are necessary for the maintenance of social structure. When you use the word <i>necessary</i> you are merely maintaining that instinctive fear to fit into society, and therefore you are not truly individual, which does not mean that you must do the opposite. I have said, you will find true individuality only when you have discovered the right values of the social standard. Until then you cannot be true individuals. So when you discover the right values of social standards or any standards - religious, ethical, or political, all the standards that human beings have created - when you really understand, then you will not ask, “Are certain actions necessary for the maintenance of society?”</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You say that self-analysis is death. I understand your meaning to be that intellectual dissection and examination are destructive. If, however, analysis could be a process whereby energy hitherto absorbed in conflict released itself emotionally and, to a lesser extent intellectually, with no ultimate achievement in view, would not such a process come near to an understanding of awareness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You want to release that energy which is now taken up in conflict. I say, you cannot free that vital energy through self-analysis, but you can release it only when you are in the movement of action. To me, self-analysis implies not that movement but rather the staying back and examining to understand, withholding from that movement in order to examine, and to me it does not release understanding. Whereas, if you are fully awake in action, then out of that comes awareness of the many hindrances. Please, this is very simple. Our mind is used to analyze our actions, our emotions. There is always the observer, the controller, the guide watching. Your mind now is nothing but an instrument to warn you of the coming fears, of the coming hopes, always alert, cunning. So our actions are stultified. Whereas, if you were to meet the very next thought or emotion or action with all your being, then you will know the hindrances that prevent you from releasing that creative energy. In other words, do not try to solve the problem, but meet the next thought, or next emotion, or next action - all being the same - fully, then you will know the cause of the problem in which you are caught.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Your hint that the new social structure must not be based on selfishness is not possible in practical life. Want is bringing men more and more to selfishness, for themselves and for their families. Self-interest in the work leads people to greater effort and it develops the faculties. Can’t you help us to a deeper insight in the practical possibilities of social construction? After all, one must cooperate in creating, above all, better material circumstances and possibilities of work.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First of all, I never give a hint, because it is quite obvious what I say; it is not a hint. I am afraid it was a sledgehammer, but if you like take it as a hint.</p>
<p>Now, if it is not practical, why do you bother about it? Have you tested it, to find out if it is practical? What you call “practical” is a complete system, a complete mold in which you can fit without the least trouble, to carry on as you are without alteration, without thought, without a deepening process of life. So, as you have not experimented with it, how can you possibly say it is not practical? You don’t experiment because you are frightened. You know, if you really felt, some of you, the futility of laying up, and experiment with it - not propaganda, converting the other fellow, but really felt and tested and acted from that, you would see how practical it is, how simple life becomes.</p>
<p>We are afraid, with regard to security, what will happen. “I am old,” you say to yourself, “What shall I do when I am old?” or, “As I am old I cannot give up security.” That is quite right. I am not asking you to give up but to be free from the idea of security. This needs very careful, frank thinking; otherwise you say, “I am free from security but I can have a good balance in the bank.” I am not saying that you must not have money, but it is the <i>idea</i> of security.</p>
<p>So friends, first of all, to make anything practical you have to experiment with it - and I do not think you have experimented - to say it is impractical. You don’t feel strongly about it, and hence the impracticality, the vagueness of it all.</p>
<p>With regard to cooperation, which is also implied in the question, I think that there cannot be cooperation until there is true individuality. Please understand what I mean by true individuality - not individualistic action, which is limited action. Now we are too willing to cooperate with a boss, with an authority on top, who tells us exactly what we are to do, spiritually, economically, and socially. In all our acts we are quite willing to be guided, to be told what to do. We feel, if only there were a good leader, the world would be perfectly right. So we are looking to leaders and not to the true function of individuality. When you are attempting to understand true individuality, you are bound to cooperate, because that is part of it. In that there is no individuality as against cooperation. Now you place cooperation as against individuality, and that is what I feel to be the utter chaos in this world. We are having greater and greater organizations politically to control men, vast legislation to shape men more and more, and I think there will be greater and greater chaos. You may be made all one kind of slave to a particular idea through a legislation and a few years later another slave to another idea through legislation. So we are merely cogs moving from different prisons, moving in different machines, different systems. I do not call that cooperation. It is blindness. In that there is no living, no spontaneity of fullness. Whereas, there is, and there will be, there must be cooperation when you as an individual understand the true function of individuality, which is to discover right values. No system, no philosopher, no one on earth is going to tell you what right values are. There are eternal right values. You will find out. I can tell you, but it means nothing because you will take those in place of the old; that is, you will be a slave to a new kind of order. It may be superficially well arranged, but there will be a rotten core inside.</p>
<p>If we do not cooperate, we cannot do anything in life. There must be cooperation. Everything we do must be done by two, three, four, or by a million. To bring about right cooperation there must be right understanding of individuality, and if there is not right understanding, it is not cooperation; it is merely exertion of brutal authority - spiritually, politically, or any way you like.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>In the life of individuals as well as in groups, there is action, not only individually conditioned but also conditioned by historical factors which appeal to us from the past: their imminent effect, not only intellectual, and not to be evaded, meets me everywhere though I personally have totally freed myself from traditions, ceremonies, etc. A human being ignoring this very source of its being, is like a tree that tries to prevent the growing in the depth of its own roots. I wonder why you do not speak of this aspect of life though it certainly is no less essential than all that a human being can do and be of itself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>My point is discovering in action all right values; whereas, you bring up all the past, whether it is of yesterday or of a century ago. I happen to be a Hindu, a Brahmin, soaked in tradition, older, more rigid than any of yours. I do not sit down and examine the historical tradition which has bound me to inherited centuries of history, or the various little traditions that hold me as a Hindu; but in moving I become aware of all these anchors - historical, religious, national, family, personal prejudices - and in that movement of real creative thinking there is intelligence. That is truly thought, not this mere reaction back and forth of an established background from which you think. We call that <i>thinking,</i> and therefore thinking leaves us more and more empty, more and more shallow.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>What is the normal place of sex in the life of the individual - from your point of view?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There are sex regulations and legislations for a man who is a slave to sex. There is creative energy, and because we have lost real understanding of that creative energy, we are caught up in sexual problems, not that that is not also creative or that it is something to be looked down on, despised, or reveled in - it is the same, reveling in them or despising them. You may say, “We have lost the true creative power.” So long as you do not realize that creative power, you will be a slave to your passions, and there must be legislations to control passionate people, because passionate people like everyone else are promiscuous; they have no sense of proportion, and hence for them there must be legislation. So the thing is how to realize that creative power. You will not be bothered, nor will you despise it, nor will you revel in it; it is a part of your whole being. To realize that creative thing, that life itself, that divinity, that infinite becoming, free your mind from all these conformities, this process of your thinking to which you have conformed, your action which is limited. If you really release your mind and heart from imitation, free the mind from the certainty - in that there is a creative ecstasy which is life itself. Then there is not a sexual problem, a moral problem, an intellectual problem. Then you do not distinguish sex from other acts, then you are a complete human being, because such a human being is truly creative and hence spontaneous.</p>
