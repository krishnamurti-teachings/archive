<p>Friends,</p>
<p>To understand the constant movement of life, the mind must be free from the burden of explanatory knowledge; it must be free from the attempt to hold the self-protective lessons of experience. It must meet life anew every day, and in that meeting there is understanding.</p>
<p>Most of us, I think, realize consciously or unconsciously that there is an emptiness, an insufficiency in our lives, and we try to run away from that insufficiency, through sensation, through forgetfulness, or through work. In the search for sensation we go from one experience to another; we desire greater variety in sensation, and this movement of sensation we call experience. Yet that empty void, that loneliness, does not cease to exist. We are simply trying to get away from it through experience, and this attempt to escape, this effort to fill it with experience, with mere knowledge, only creates greater insufficiency. Where there is an emptiness there is always a craving and a grasping.</p>
<p>Where there is wanting there can never be discernment. Choice, which is based on want, can never bring about discernment. Choice is the conflict of the opposites. In choosing between opposites, you merely create further opposites. What is considered to be the essential becomes the unessential, and this movement is not progress. Choice creates the opposites. As long as the mind is caught in this system of opposites there can never be discernment. Wanting prevents discernment. Where there is want there is emptiness. You cannot destroy it, get rid of it, but you have to discover the cause that creates want. Now, because there is insufficiency in yourself, you try to fill that emptiness through sensation of various kinds, from the gross forms to the most subtle. Want exists only when there is not the right understanding of values. When you realize this with your whole being, then you will begin to discern the intrinsic value of all things; then you will no longer perceive values as merely the result of opposites.</p>
<p>When there is want, action must be incomplete. Now, that incompleteness further increases the emptiness of mind and heart.</p>
<p>In awareness is discernment, in which there is no choice. Choice is a ceaseless struggle, a constant conflict.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Please explain clearly what you mean by frankness as distinguished from sincerity. Do you mean that we must first be absolutely true in ourselves in what we do, feel, and think in order to understand life in the whole?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What I mean by sincerity is this: You have an ideal, a preconception, or a pattern in your mind, in accordance with which you shape your thought and conduct. You try to be sincere to that ideal or principle. So a person who so shapes his life, who holds rigidly to an idea or principle, you call “sincere.” The more closely he lives according to that principle (and principles, ideals must be limited) the more sincere he is. But to me, such a person can never understand the flow of reality.</p>
<p>Now, frankness is openness, which reveals actuality, the present, without any bias. Only by being intelligently frank can you find out your own limitation. You cannot do this by merely being sincere to an ideal, to a hope. You can discover your little vanities, hindrances, and conceits only through absolute frankness.</p>
<p>First you must find out what you are; only then will you know how to act with regard to what you discover. Most people think according to a certain pattern or principle, or their thought is influenced or controlled by environment, which must naturally hinder the flow of reality. To discover these hindrances, mind must become aware of its own thoughts, and in intelligently allowing them freedom, you will then begin to discern the secretive fears and hopes that are constantly throwing up barriers against the full expression of life, which causes suffering. This needs great frankness and awakened desire to understand, but if there is want, intelligent comprehension of the present is destroyed. This lack of discernment creates duality in action, and this incompleteness is the cause of suffering.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>I have found that in the process of getting rid of personal barriers one feels the urge for self-discipline. Yet you say that you do not believe in self-discipline. What do you mean by self-discipline?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wonder if you have asked this question really to find out what I think, or are you so strongly in favor of self-discipline that you feel you have to oppose what I have to say with regard to it? If you are steadfastly opposed to what I say, then that is the end of the discussion. Because I talk about the futility of self-discipline, don’t think that you must not have self-discipline. The majority of you assembled here have already made up your minds that self-discipline is essential. You have practiced it for years. Your system and beliefs demand it, your religions insist upon it, your sacred books cry aloud concerning it, and you yourselves hold it to be of great value. But if you want to find out what I think about it, you must try to understand the whole significance of self-discipline and not merely a part of it.</p>
<p>A mind that is being consistent must submit itself to self-discipline. Now, why has it to be consistent? Isn’t it because it cannot understand the swift movement of the present? Isn’t it because it cannot follow the rapid change and significance of experience? Because the mind cannot meet experience, life - completely, wholly - it resorts to a standard, to authority behind which it takes shelter, afraid to meet the unknown. For the understanding of experience, there is no precedent. The mind tries to live in the vibrant fullness of today with the burden of dead yesterdays. Thus, the present action is being forced into the channels of the past. Out of this there arises the dictum, born of fear, “I must,” or “I must not.”</p>
<p>Look to the lack of understanding that demands self-discipline, and not to the best method of discipline. You are one thing today and another thing tomorrow. You are different today from what you will be tomorrow. Yet the mind is forcing and twisting itself to follow a certain rule, and thereby you are creating a conflict. Thus, there is never completeness in action, that true fulfillment.</p>
<p>Consistency involves memory; it involves the remembrance of a certain ideal, a certain pattern which is predetermined, based on self-protection and on fear. The memory of that which is already dead disciplines you. Now, if you are constantly acting in accordance with that memory, how can you live spontaneously, or follow the swift wanderings of truth? There must be the understanding of the significance of the desire to be consistent, the cause, before abandoning self-discipline, the result.</p>
<p>Because one does not meet every incident of life wholly, there arises conflict which creates memory. Mind identifies itself with this suffering, out of which it creates for itself a self-protective principle, and by this measure all experiences are judged and controlled. It is in suffering only that the mind tries to escape, consciously or unconsciously, to the pattern, and from this there arises the defensive “I must” and “I must not.” If you can discern the cause of fear, which brings forth these self-protective ideals which demand consistency and the rigid following of a discipline, then with out the effort of overcoming the fear, the mind will free itself from it.</p>
<p>As there is great separation between thought and action, there must be conflict, suffering; and self-discipline is thought necessary to bridge this gulf, to realize completeness. Through self-discipline, there can never be completeness of action. It is to be realized only when the mind is free from self-protective barriers, prejudices, and fears. The mere adjustment to a pattern through self-discipline, control, destroys the significance and the revealing depth of action; thus, the mind and heart gradually become barren and vainly empty.</p>
<p>“I have found that in the process of getting rid of our personal barriers, one feels the urge for self-discipline.” What is conquered is not lasting. Only through understanding of the cause of limitations do they disappear, yielding place to intelligence. Where there is an overcoming, there is bondage. In conquering there is no intelligence; there is only subjugation and hidden decay. All conquering indicates the attraction of something beyond, but the cause of limitation still remains. It is only in the intelligent understanding of the cause of hindrances that there is freedom from suffering.</p>
<p>Your attempt to overcome limitations is urged by the desire for reward. So you have not overcome your barrier at all; you have disciplined yourself merely in order to get something else. And because you are thinking of what you will get in return for your action, for your self-discipline, your action and your discipline have no value at all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Must one be free of craving in order to attain liberation? If so, how can liberation be attained without the exercise of self-control and self-discipline?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Craving without understanding creates conflict, and to escape from this suffering there is a search for truth, happiness, liberation. So instead of looking for liberation, for truth, let us concern ourselves with that which is more familiar to us - conflict and suffering - with the actuality rather than with illusions which offer us convenient escapes, shelters. So let us concern ourselves with the cause of suffering. The very desire, conscious or unconscious, to avoid suffering, to find a substitute for it and to cultivate its opposite, brings about the lack of comprehension of the present. The many prejudices, limitations, that the mind has built around itself in its search for self-protections, create sorrow when they come into contact with the ever-living quality of experience. This suffering is not to be overcome through self-discipline and self-control, but when the mind frees itself from the self-protective limitations and illusions, there is the ecstasy of life. This liberation from the false, from the stupid, is not to be realized through self-analysis, but in the awareness of action itself. Self-discipline is but conformity to an established form of escape, an ideal, and in this there is no intelligence. Awareness, that discernment without conformity, without compulsion, reveals the illusions and hindrances which are concealed, preventing the mind from the fullness of action, which alone makes of life an eternal becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>In the discussion gathering it was stated that a man could get rid of his hindrances by understanding them. Consequently, we must assume that if we feel that our hindrances have not yet disappeared, it is because we have not yet totally understood them. Many of us feel that hindrances increase when we make an effort to understand them.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Naturally they do, because you make an effort to rid yourself of the many hindrances in order to gain truth, happiness, or liberation. You lay the emphasis on liberation, truth, because it offers an escape, and so the hindrances increase and flourish. Why do you make an effort to understand your hindrances? If you are deeply desirous of finding out your hindrances, you don’t make an effort, do you? But because there is not this consuming desire, you force yourself to make an effort.</p>
<p>Want cripples discernment, causing misery and anguish. Effort is made to overcome this, without understanding its cause. Want is the result of false values. You cannot understand right values when the mind is hindered by prejudices and fears; you must become aware of these prejudices and fears. But such consciousness, such awareness, is not born of effort, but of intense, purposive desire to understand the cause which obstructs pure discernment.</p>
<p>The desire for security is an impediment to discernment, but if you intelligently pursue it, you will find out for yourself its true significance. But perhaps your mind perceives the illusory nature of security, but still there is an intense desire for it. Out of this contradiction there arises conflict and suffering, incompleteness of action. To overcome this incompleteness, you begin to control yourself, discipline yourself. But this does not in any way eliminate conflict. This contradiction exists because you do not deeply desire to discern the true significance of security, with its comforting ideals and illusions. Until there is this burning desire to understand, you must continue with suffering, put up with all the innumerable stupidities and exploitations.</p>
