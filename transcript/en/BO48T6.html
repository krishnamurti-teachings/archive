<p>The problem of existence is not at one level, but at different levels of action, and they are all interrelated. The psychological problem is related to the physical; and if we try to solve the problem of food, clothing, and shelter on its own level, we shall find that we shall not come to a true solution. No problem can be solved on its own level. Departmental thinking can in no way solve the problem of existence. We have to think of our existence as a whole, as a total process, and not an unrelated action at different levels. Our life is a movement of contradictions. We talk of peace and our actions are for war; we think of freedom and our life is regimented; we seek creativeness and our mind is the result of imitation and habit; we are poor and seek riches; being violent, we pursue the ideal of nonviolence; we desire to be happy, and we do everything to bring about unhappiness.</p>
<p>Now, to choose one of the contradictions is to avoid action; choice at all times is a process of avoidance of action. Choice will not bring about integration, but only right thinking will. There can be no right thinking when there is contradiction. When we know how to think rightly, contradiction will cease. We will have to find out what is true thinking and not be caught in choice - choice between good and evil, peace and war, poverty and riches, regimentation and freedom.</p>
<p>As contradiction is the very nature of the self, which is the seat of desire, merely to choose one of the desires does not lead to understanding. Choice between the essential and the nonessential is still the outcome of desire. Choice is desire, and desire in its very nature is contradictory. So, choice only strengthens the self, only the self-enclosing process of the 'you' and the 'me'. The understanding of desire is the beginning of self-knowledge. Without self-knowledge there is no true thinking. If you do not know the total process of yourself - not only through the responses of your daily activities, but by being aware of the different psychological levels - then you live in a state of contradiction. To choose one of the contradictions only strengthens the enclosing process, and so such action breeds further contradiction. So, choice between the opposites does not lead to happiness, does not bring peace. Only right thinking can bring about happiness. Happiness is not an end in itself. It is a byproduct of something far greater than the result of choice.</p>
<p>Right thought and right thinking are two different states. Right thought is merely a conformity to a pattern, to a system. Right thought is static; it involves the constant friction of choice. Right thinking or true thinking is to be discovered. It cannot be learned. It cannot be practiced. Right thinking is a movement of self-knowledge from moment to moment. This movement of self-knowledge exists in the awareness of relationship.</p>
<p>Mind can be disciplined to conform to a pattern of right thought; but disciplining, which is the movement of a pattern, can never result in right thinking. Right thought always has a result in view and so it can never go beyond itself; whereas, right thinking comes into being through the awareness of the activities of the self, which must be experienced and discovered from moment to moment. So, right thinking has no goal, no end in view. Desire is never static and so the self is never still. It is ever struggling to gain and to avoid. The self is not only the higher, but the lower self. This division is arbitrary, and so not real; this division is a form of escape; this division - which so many indulge in - is still within the field of consciousness, and so still within the thought process.</p>
<p>Right thinking can only come into being when there is awareness of every thought and feeling, the awareness not only of a particular group of thoughts and feelings, but of all thoughts and all feelings. The unfolding of these thoughts and feelings is put an end to by condemnation, and condemnation is choice. Condemnation is a form of inaction, for understanding demands action, not choice. Though you think that choice brings about action, if you examine closely you will find that choice invariably leads to inaction, to isolation. Choice can never bring about understanding, as condemnation only builds resistance, preventing understanding; choice is another form of self-protective response. This inaction, which outwardly seems so active, has led man to destruction and misery. This inaction, projected outwardly as the social structure, brings about disintegration.</p>
<p>There can only be creative action through right thinking. Right thinking is a constant discovery of the full significance of every thought and feeling. To be passively yet alertly aware of every movement of thought and feeling, of the motives, of the intentions that are hidden, brings about right thinking. It is only right thinking, which is the outcome of self-knowledge, that can solve the many problems that confront each one of us.</p>
<p>Questioner: Is not the longing expressed in prayer a way to God?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: In this question there are several things involved - not only prayer, but concentration and meditation. What do we mean by prayer? In prayer is there not involved petition, supplication? The state of open receptivity, the state of sensitivity without the self-enclosing process of demand, is surely not prayer, but one of the highest forms of meditation. Most prayers are petitions or the search for guidance. This petition for guidance indicates, does it not, that being confused, being in pain, you seek clarity and joy through what you call God. You and I have created the confusion, the misery, this utter want of love; and so, you pray for a higher entity to clear up this confusion and conflict. But, since you have created this force of destruction and violence, you have to clear it up, and not someone else.</p>
<p>When you pray for something, it generally comes into being. But you have to pay the price for it. The price is not understanding; the price is another form of conflict and misery. What you demand, you receive, and this gift is the outcome of your own self. How can God answer your particular demands? Can the immeasurable, the unutterable, be concerned with your petty little worries, miseries, confusions, and your national calamities which you have created for yourself? So, what is it that answers? Surely, your own hidden layers of consciousness. It may bring a momentary clarity, gratification, but such answers are not of the highest. At the moment of prayer, you are faintly silent, in a mild state of receptivity, and so the active mind being comparatively still, the hidden projects itself and you have an answer. It is your own layers of consciousness that respond and not that which you call God.</p>
<p>Reality must come to you, you cannot go to it. If you invite it to help you to solve your problems, to give you the direction for conduct, then it ceases to be the real. The small voice that is heard in prayer, when the mind is superficially quiet, is the intimation of your own being. This voice surely is not the voice of God. How can a mind that is confused, craving, ignorant, petitioning, understand reality? Reality can come into being only when the mind is absolutely still, not asking, not seeking; when desire ceases, only then reality comes into being.</p>
<p>Concentration is a process of exclusion. Concentration is brought about through effort, compulsion, and direction. So, concentration is a process of exclusion. This concentration takes different forms. You know the concentration that is demanded in earning your livelihood, but concentration that is demanded in so-called meditation is what we are concerned with here. As the mind wanders when you try to meditate, you try to fix your mind on a picture or an image or on a phrase. But since your mind insists on wandering off, you try to force it back on the object of your interest. This constant battle with your thoughts is generally called meditation. You try to concentrate on something in which you are not interested, and so there is multiplicity of thought and vagrancy. So, you spend your energy in warding off. If you can concentrate on your particular desire or object, you think you have at last succeeded in your meditation, but surely this is not meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation is not an exclusive process, a process of building up resistance. So, concentration as exclusion is not meditation. Concentration becomes a form of escape. To sit in front of a picture of your Master, your guru, of an image, or to do rituals is also an escape. For, without self-knowledge, there is no right thinking; and without true thinking, what you do has no meaning, however noble your intentions are. These escapes only dull the mind and weary the heart.</p>
<p>It is comparatively easy to concentrate. A general planning war, planning the butchery of man, is very concentrated. A businessman trying to pull off a deal is concentrated. A man who is interested in anything is naturally, spontaneously concentrated on it. But concentration is not meditation. The concentration on what you want, what you desire, is not meditation. Meditation is understanding. Meditation of the heart is understanding. How can there be understanding if there is exclusion? How can there be understanding when there is petition? Understanding comes when there is freedom. You are liberated from that which you understand. Understanding is the way, the foundation of meditation. Prayer and concentration lead to obstinacy, to fixation, to illusion. Understanding brings about freedom, clarity, and joy. Understanding comes when the right significance of all things is gathered. To be ignorant is to give wrong values. Stupidity is the lack of comprehending right values.</p>
<p>How is one to establish the right value of property, of relationship, of ideas? For the true to come into being, you must understand the thinker, must you not? If you do not know the thinker, which is yourself, what you choose has no meaning. If you do not know yourself, your action of choice has no foundation whatsoever. So, self-knowledge is the beginning of meditation, not the knowledge that you pick up from books, from authorities, from gurus, but that knowledge which comes into being through passive awareness, experience, and discovery. Without self-knowledge, there is no meditation. If you do not understand the ways of your thoughts, your feelings, and your desires, the patterns of action which are ideas, then there is no foundation for thought. The thinker who merely asks, prays, or excludes without understanding himself must end in confusion and illusion. So, the beginning of understanding is self-knowledge, being aware of every movement of thought and feeling, to be aware of all the layers of consciousness.</p>
<p>To know the deep activities, the concealed motives and responses, the conscious mind must be still to receive the projections of the hidden layers. The conscious mind is occupied with the daily activities connected with earning a living, of exploiting others, of anger and greed, of running away from problems. This conscious mind must understand its own activities and bring about tranquillity to itself. It cannot bring about tranquillity by mere regimentation, by compulsion, by discipline. It can bring about tranquillity by becoming aware of its own activities, by observing silently its actions towards its immediate relations and others. Thus, a conscious mind becomes fully aware of its own activities, thus bringing about tranquillity to the superficial layers; then only is it in a position to receive the intimations of the hidden layers of consciousness. Only when all these projections have been understood, and the whole consciousness is unburdened of the past, then only can it receive the eternal. As the pool is quiet when the breeze has stopped, so the mind is quiet when the thinker, the creator of the problem, ceases. Then only that which is immeasurable comes into being.</p>
<p>Questioner: Why is your teaching so purely psychological? There is no cosmology, no theology, no ethics, no aesthetics, no sociology, no political science, and not even hygiene. Why do you concentrate on the mind only and its workings?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: If the thinker can understand himself, then he will have solved all his problems. Then only is there creation. Then only is there reality. For then, what he does will not be antisocial. Virtue is not an end in itself. Virtue brings freedom and there can be freedom only when the thinker ceases.</p>
<p>It is important to know the process of the mind, the bundle of memories it creates, the 'me'. I and the 'mine'. Because the thinker is confused, his actions are confused. Because he is confused, he seeks order and peace. Because he is ignorant, he seeks knowledge. Because he is in contradiction, he seeks out authority for conduct, which is ethics. Because he is confused and driven by desires, he is antisocial. Because he does not understand himself, he cannot understand reality. So, if the thinker, the mind, can understand itself, then the whole problem is solved; then there will be no antisocial actions; then it will not exploit another or things as a means of self-expansion, thus causing conflict between man and man; then there will be no caste, no nationality, no division of belief; then there will be love. So, the importance is not in cosmology, nor in theology, nor in hygiene, though hygiene is necessary and theology and cosmology are unnecessary; but what is important is to understand the ways of the mind, the self.</p>
<p>Is the thinker different from his thoughts? If thought ceases, is there a thinker? When the qualities of the thinker are removed, where is the thinker? Is there the 'me' without its qualities? So, thoughts themselves are the thinker. There are only the thoughts and not the thinker. The thinker has separated himself from his thoughts in order to safeguard himself and to give himself permanency. He can always modify his thoughts according to circumstances, and yet he remains. When he begins to modify himself, to transform himself, the thinker ceases. Because he is afraid to cease, he is occupied with the modification of thought. The thinker is not if the thought is not, and the mere modification of thought does not do away with the thinker. So, it is one of the cunning actions of the mind to separate the thinker from his thoughts, and to be very concerned with them. So, the self gives itself permanency; but it is not permanent, whether the higher or the lower self; for it is still in the field of memory, within the net of time.</p>
<p>Why I am laying so much emphasis and urgency on psychological transformation is because the mind, the self, is the cause of our strife and misery, of our confusion and antagonism. Without understanding this, merely to reform, merely to trim the superficial actions has very little meaning. We have pruned our thoughts for generations, and have brought about such confusing madness and misery. Now we have to go to the very root of the problem of existence, of consciousness, which is the 'me' and the 'mine'. Without understanding the thinker and his activities, mere superficial social reforms have very little significance, at least for the man who is earnest. So, it is important for each one to find out for oneself on what to lay emphasis - whether on the superficial, the outward, or on the fundamental.</p>
<p>If you are persuaded by me to lay emphasis on the inward nature of man, then you will merely be imitative, and you will equally be persuaded by another to lay emphasis on the outer. So, you must think out this problem very earnestly and not wait for somebody to tell you on what to lay emphasis. What fundamental value is there in trimming the environmental influences and conditions? When man is inwardly sick, diseased, and confused, power politics and organized religions, ideologies and systems cannot heal this burning disease.</p>
<p>Help comes only when the cause of disease is eradicated, the disease in yourself. An earnest man is concerned with the understanding and with the eradication of the disease. There will be outward order and peace when there is inward order and peace, for the inward always overcomes the outward. A happy and peaceful man is not in conflict with his neighbor. It is only the ignorant man that is in conflict, and his actions are antisocial. A man who understands himself is at peace, and so his actions are peaceful.</p>
<p>Questioner: You have said that all being is in love only, and that what we call progress is merely a process of disintegration. Chaos is always with us, and there is no progress or regress in chaos.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: There is technological progress, but otherwise we are rapidly disintegrating. This technological progress is worshipped, but is there progress of our mind and heart? The transforming energy comes through love and where there is charity. All technological progress without love leads to destruction and disintegration. From the cartwheel to the jet plane is progress, but do you, your psychological being, evolve at all?</p>
<p>What is the thing that evolves, and towards what? Ignorance can never evolve to wisdom. Greed can never become that which is not greed. Greed will always be greed though it progresses. Ignorance through time can never become wisdom. Ignorance must cease for wisdom, greed must cease for the being of nongreed. When you indulge in the talk of evolving or progressing, you mean becoming: you are this and you will become that; you are a clerk and you will become the manager; you are the ordinary priest and you will become the bishop; you are evil and you will eventually become good. This becoming you call evolving. This evolving, becoming, is merely a continuity of what is in a modified form, and so becoming can never bring about transformation. In becoming, in continuity, there is never rebirth. Only in ending is there being. Where there is love, there is no compulsion. When you love, the 'me' and the 'mine' ceases. It is the 'me' and the 'mine' that is ever in search of continuity, it is ever seeking growth. That which grows knows decay, and that which continues knows death.</p>
<p>Questioner: We know that thought destroys feeling. How to feel without thinking?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: We know that rationalization, calculation, bargaining, destroy love. Love is dangerous, for love might lead you to all unpremeditated action. You control it by rationalizing, and thereby bring it to the market-place. Where there is thought process, which is naming or terming, love is destroyed. You have a feeling of pain or pleasure. By terming it, by giving it a name - that is, by thinking about it - you have modified it and therefore reduced it. When you feel generous and open, your mind comes in and begins to rationalize your generosity; then you become charitable through organizations and avoid direct action. As love is dangerous, you begin to think about and so minimize it, and slowly destroy it.</p>
<p>Is it possible to love without thinking? What do you mean by thinking? Thinking is a response to memories of pain or pleasure. There is no thinking without the residue which incomplete experience leaves. Love is different from emotion and feeling. Love cannot be brought into the field of thought, whereas feeling and emotion can be brought. Love is a flame without smoke, ever fresh, creative, joyous. Such love is dangerous to society, to relationship. So, thought steps in, modifies, guides it, legalizes it, puts it out of danger; then one can live with it. Do you not know that when you love someone, you love the whole of mankind? Do you not know how dangerous it is to love man? Then, there is no harrier, no nationality; then, there is no craving for power and position, and things assume their values. Such a man is a danger to society.</p>
<p>For the being of love, the process of memory must come to an end. Memory comes into being only when experience is not fully, completely understood. Memory is only the residue of experience; it is the result of a challenge which is not fully comprehended. Life is a process of challenge and response. Challenge is always new but the response is ever old. This response, which is conditioning, which is the result of the past, must be understood and not disciplined or condemned away. It means living each day anew, fully and completely. This complete living is possible only when there is love, when your heart is full, not with the words nor with the things made by the mind. Only where there is love, memory ceases; then every movement is a rebirth.</p>
