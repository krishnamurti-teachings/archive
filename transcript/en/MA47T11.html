<p>From our daily contact with our neighbors and with the incidents of our existence, we must observe the increasing confusion and misery, socially and religiously. How are we to understand this mounting conflict and disaster and bring order and happiness out of it? Most of us are concerned, vaguely or intensely, with this problem of conflict and sorrow. Those who are taken up with systems as a means of producing order and peace are not concerned with man's happiness, but with their particular system, with their particular solution. So we are not considering any system or organization of society, but how to bring about order and peace out of this conflict and confusion.</p>
<p>To go far you must begin near; you must begin with that which is close, that which is near, close to yourself. You are the center of all this conflict and sorrow, of this confused puzzle and cruelty. In trying to understand this confusing puzzle, we seem to miss this basic factor: you, the individual. You are the center in the whole structure of society. So what is the relationship between this confusion and misery and yourself? This confusion and misery does not come into being by itself; you and I have created them; they are the outcome of any system - capitalistic, communistic, or fascist. You and I have brought about this conflict and antagonism in our relationship with each other. What you are the world is. What you are within you project without, which is society. Your problem is the world's problem. This is a basic fact, is it not? Yet we seem to overlook this fact and give importance to systems, to ideas, as a means of bringing about revolution in values. We seem to forget that you in your relationship with another build the structure of society, either bringing about order and peace, or conflict and confusion.</p>
<p>So, we must begin near; we must begin with our everyday existence, with our daily thoughts, feelings, and actions. To bring about a radical transformation in your life, you must consider the means of right livelihood, your relationship with the near or with the distant, and your ideas and beliefs. Your livelihood is now the outcome of envy and not based on the requirement of daily needs. The means of livelihood has now become the way of acquiring power, position, prestige, and so on, which breed conflict and antagonism; this progressive becoming, from the clerk to the manager, from the priest to the bishop, has created a society in which competition and ruthlessness are inevitable. If you are only concerned with daily needs and not with the acquisition of power, then you will find the right means of earning a livelihood. Envy is the most destructive factor in our social relationship, which ultimately leads to power politics. The clerk seeking to become the manager, and the manager the director, is one of the causes of misery and destruction. He who is seeking power and position is directly responsible for war and confusion.</p>
<p>Our relationship is a process of self-isolation; each one is building a wall of self-enclosure, which excludes love, only breeding ill will and misery. In this so-called relationship, jealousy, dominance, passion are inevitable, for each one is seeking security, and so relationship is conflict, from which one tries to escape through various ways, gross or subtle. There can be love only when this self-isolating process of gratification ceases. Are not beliefs and formulations distorting our thought process? Giving wrong values to things made by the hand or by the mind is stupidity; this stupidity is the guiding factor in our daily life. It is this stupidity, as belief in a religious or political system, that sets man against man. Stupidity breeds envy and ill will, conflict and misery.</p>
<p>Such is our daily existence; to bring order out of this confusion is the beginning of virtue. The outward confusion is the projection of our inward state, of our inward conflict and misery. To bring order out of this inward confusion is virtue. Virtue can only come into being through self-knowledge. You can bring about peace and happiness only through self-knowledge and not through any system, religious or political. To know yourself is very arduous, but it is easy to follow and discipline yourself after a system, to give yourself over to a party of the right or of the left. To follow authority puts an end to thought and to self-knowledge. To be aware of your daily thoughts, feelings, and actions is strenuous, and so you escape into social activities and reforms, into addictions of every kind. The thoughtless are consumed with the reformation of society, of confusion and misery, which are the results of their inward daily thoughts and activities.</p>
<p>Self-knowledge is not the knowledge of some supreme or higher self, which is still within the field of the mind, but the knowledge and the understanding of your thoughts, feelings, and actions from moment to moment. From this self-knowledge and understanding there comes right thinking and right action. Right action can be understood when there is self-awareness, but right action is difficult to understand when it is considered theoretically. No system, religious or secular, can bring happiness, peace, and order out of this conflict and confusion and misery, for you have created it, you and I have created it through our envy, ill will, and stupidity. In self-knowledge alone is there hope for man and not in any system or leader. For self-knowledge brings about order and peace; it brings freedom which is virtue. In this liberation alone can the real come into being.</p>
<p>Questioner: Can an ignorant man, with many responsibilities, understand and so carry out your teachings without the aid of another, without resorting to teachers and books?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Can understanding be given by another? Can love be taught? Can a guru, a teacher, or a book lead you to love? Can they teach you how to be merciful, to be generous, and the way of understanding? Can you follow another and be free? Can you accept authority and yet be free? Surely there is creativeness only when there is freedom, inward freedom, when there is no fear, no imitation. Who is the ignorant man? An ignorant man is he who does not know himself, the learned man is ignorant if he does not know himself. The merely learned man, by giving wrong value to knowledge, is caught in the net of his own stupidity. Understanding comes only through self-knowledge, the knowledge of your total process, and not one part of it, the psychological or the physical, for they are interactive. Self-knowledge is arduous, for it demands constant awareness, which is not introspection. Introspection is a process of self-improvement, with its conflicts and condemnations, its morbidity and confusion. But awareness is wholly different from introspection. Awareness is a process of your everyday thought, feeling, and action with their condemnation, justification, or identification. To understand, there cannot be condemnation or identification, so when there is alert passivity, understanding comes. So self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom.</p>
<p>The questioner wants to know if an ignorant man, with many responsibilities, can understand and carry out the teachings without the aid of a teacher or a book. If he accepts authority of any kind there can be no understanding. Authority is ever blinding, whether it is outer or inner. Responsibility implies relationship, does it not? Relationship is a process of self-knowledge, revealing the ways of the self, the ways of the thinker. There is no existence in isolation; to be is to be related. A man who seeks to avoid the world is still related; he is running away from conflict and not understanding it. In relationship, which is activity between you and another, the ways of the self are revealed. Surely, to know yourself, what you think and feel and do, you don't have to go to a guru or to a book, do you? To think out, to feel out every thought and feeling is arduous; to see their implication and meaning demands earnest and swift pliability. None can assist you in this pursuit. You and I can talk over a problem, go into it significantly with the thoroughness of a consecrated mind, with that penetrating interest. You go to another, to a teacher, only when the deep interest to understand is gone, when interest itself is the search, devotion itself. Therein lies the misfortune. When you are interested, when you are aware of the significance of relationship, then that very awareness unfolds the ways of your thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>So the problem is not whether you should go to teachers and books, but to be aware, to be aware simply of what you are thinking, feeling, and doing when you talk to your friends, to your wives, and children. Be aware and discover self-knowledge. If you are aware, you will perceive that conflict and pain increase, for then you begin to see the significance of your thoughts, feelings, and actions. To escape from conflict and pain you turn to teachers and books; in them there is no understanding of your conflict and pain. The teachers and books introduce other problems and other miseries. There is no creative joy in following, in copying an example; creativeness comes into being only where there is freedom. Only when the activities of the self, of the thinker, are quiet and still, then only is there the ecstasy of the real. Only in that state, when the mind is not burdened by its own self-created fears and hopes, conflicts and sorrow, is there creative joy. This joy cannot be taught by another or given to you by another. It comes into being only when the problems are understood and so dissolved.</p>
<p>To be aware from moment to moment is arduous, demanding swift pliability. Our minds are made dull through fear, through copying and tradition, through the worship of authority, and the pursuit of a system; it is difficult to break away from those things that make us dull and stupid. To break away necessitates action and invites perhaps more conflict; and, unwilling to face it, we turn to teachers and books who pacify us, gratifying us, and thus increasing our dullness and stupidity.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is that awareness of which you speak? Is it the awareness of the supreme, universal consciousness?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Awareness is a simple act - to be aware of the tree, of the flower, of that passing bird, of the relationship between one and another, of the thoughts, feelings, and actions. You must begin near to go far. You cannot be aware of something that you do not know. You verbally assert that there is a universal consciousness, but you do not know it; either you have been told about it or you have read about it. So it is still within the field of the mind, of memory. You are trying to be aware of that which is distant, far away, and not be aware of that which is near. It is more convenient and comforting to be aware of a formulation, of a speculating hope, than to be aware of your thoughts, feelings, and actions from moment to moment. To be aware of your daily thoughts, feelings, and actions is discomforting, painful, and so you would rather think of something in the distance, gratifying. To be aware of that which is close, to be aware of relationship - its self-enclosing process, its cruelty, its thoughtlessness - is very disturbing; so, being conscious of the immediate pain which direct awareness brings, we would rather speculate about universal consciousness, whatever that may mean, which is an escape from the actual, from what is. That of which I am speaking is the awareness of what is. The understanding of what is leads to great heights. In being aware of what is there is no possibility of self-deception.</p>
<p>Understanding comes with the awareness of what is. There can be no understanding if there is condemnation of or identification with what is. If you condemn a child or so identify yourself with him, then you cease to understand him. So, being aware of a thought or a feeling as it arises, without condemning it or identifying with it, you will find that it unfolds ever more widely and deeply, and thereby discover the whole content of what is. To understand the process of what is there must be choiceless awareness, a freedom from condemnation, justification, and identification. When you are vitally interested in fully understanding something, you give your mind and heart, withholding nothing. But unfortunately you are conditioned, educated, disciplined through religious and social environment to condemn or to identify, and not to understand. To condemn is stupid and easy, but to understand is arduous, requiring pliability and intelligence. Condemnation, as identification, is a form of self-protection. Condemnation or identification is a barrier to understanding. To understand the confusion, the misery in which one is, and so of the world, you must observe its total process; to be aware and pursue all its implications requires patience, to follow swiftly and to be still.</p>
<p>There is understanding only when there is stillness, when there is silent observation, passive awareness. Then only, the problem yields its full significance. The awareness of which I speak is of what is from moment to moment; of the activities of thought and its subtle deceptions, fears, and hope. Choiceless awareness wholly dissolves our conflicts and miseries.</p>
<p>Questioner: I am very interested in your teachings; I would like to spread them, and which is the best way?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Truth cannot be repeated; when repeated it becomes a lie. This repetition is not truth, and so propaganda is a lie. Truth is to be experienced directly. Repetition is a mere copy. That which you repeat may be a truth to him who has experienced it, but when it is repeated it becomes a lie. In this terrible net of lies, called propaganda, thought is caught.</p>
<p>You have read or heard a formulation, an idea which appeals to you, gives you gratification, and you want to tell it to your friends, you do propaganda for it. Have words greater meaning than nervous and verbal significance? Surely not. So what you are spreading, an unfortunate term, is really words, and do words dissolve our aches and sorrows, our problems? For instance, say you believe in reincarnation and you do propaganda for your belief. What are you spreading? You are spreading your conviction, your conclusions, clothed in words; and through words, through explanations, you think you have solved a complex human problem. You are caught in the lie that the word is the thing. Surely the word God is not God, but you are caught in the illusion that the word is God. So you spread the word. The word becomes all-important, the label, and not what is. You want to catch others in the net of words in which you are caught; this is propaganda. Words, explanations, set man against man. Then you will create a new system based on Krishnamurti's words which you, the propagandist, will spread for other propagandists. And what have you achieved by this? Whom have you helped? It is the height of folly to spread someone else's experiences, words, and thoughts.</p>
<p>You experience what you believe, and so it is a conditioned experience, and so not a significant, vital experience. There can be vital, true experience only when the process of thinking ceases. This significant experience you cannot spread, as information, to cover up the inward and so the outward confusion. If you give your mind and heart to a direct problem, such as nationalism or caste, it is comparatively simple to understand. Nationalism is a poison which is destroying man. This poison of race and caste is spreading more and more throughout the world. It is setting man against man; it has become a cunning instrument in the hands of the exploiter, and you want to be exploited, for nationalism feeds your craving for self-expansion. You cannot be a nationalist and yet talk of peace, for they are a contradiction. This, surely, you can understand by putting aside your nationalistic spirit, your caste, and so on; then only can you talk about the poison of nationalism, and only then can you spread your understanding.</p>
<p>Your understanding will be shown by your thoughts and actions and not by the rituals you perform or by the organizations to which you belong. There is hope only in the transformation of yourself and not in a system, either of the right or of the left. Belief separates man and sets man against man, and there can be communion only when there is love. It is by the thoughts and acts of your life that communion can be established, and not by mere words. To him who is seeking truth, the truth of words, the truth of relationship, the truth of idea, become all-significant. Truth is not some vague abstraction, but it is to be discovered in the very thoughts, feelings, and actions of our daily existence. Words become very important when the word is the thing.</p>
<p>So if you want to spread these teachings, live them and by your life you will communicate.</p>
<p>Questioner: Is marriage necessary for women?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: In marriage, sexual relationship, companionship, communion, love are implied. Without love, marriage becomes, for man or for woman, a source of gratification, of conflict, of fear and pain. Love comes into being only when the self is absent. Without love, relationship is sorrow, however physically exciting it might be; such relationship breeds contention and frustration, habit and routine. Without love there can be no chastity, and sex becomes an all-consuming problem. Without love, the ideal of chastity is an escape from the conflict of desire, and without understanding craving, the ideal leads to illusion and pain. The licentious and the ideal both deny love. The pursuit of the ideal and indulgence give importance to craving, to the 'me', and when the 'me' is emphasized, love is not.</p>
<p>There are other problems involved in this question. One of them is fulfillment. The woman or the man seeks fulfillment in the child. When the woman is deprived of this, she is starved, as she is starved when there is no love. Men seek fulfillment, when deprived of love, either in things or in children or in activity, which are all distractions. So things and action and children become all-important, leading to further confusion and further misery. Man also seeks to escape through fulfilling himself in activity, in distractions and addictions of every kind, from amusement to worship. So man and woman seek to fulfill them through things or property, through family or name, through ideas or beliefs, and so they become all-important, thus giving to them false or wrong importance, which causes inward and so outward conflict and misery.</p>
<p>Now, is there fulfillment? The craving to become can only lead to frustration, to conflict; in this becoming there is always fear and the conflict of its opposite. The craving for fulfillment, for continuity, is only when there is frustration. Being empty, there is a craving for fulfillment. Without understanding what is, which is emptiness, frustration, we pursue fulfillment, the covering up of what is. Only in understanding what is, which is the emptiness, the shallowness, the pettiness, can there be radical transformation. This transformation is true revolution. But to merely pursue fulfillment is moral and social chaos. A man who is happy, creative, is not seeking fulfillment through property, through marriage, or through ideation; he is not escaping through passion nor is he seeking fulfillment. We cease to be creative, happy, when we are imitative or merely functioning according to the responses of memory. The response of memory is generally considered thinking; such thinking is merely the response of the frame of reference. These responses are not right thinking. Right thinking comes into being only when there is no response to memory. In this passively alert awareness there is creative being. In this state, the life of becoming, with its fulfillment and conflict, fades away. This state is love. Because our hearts are dry, we fill them with the things of the mind, which give rise to multiple problems.</p>
<p>Love is not a thing to be learned; it comes into being when you, the problem, cease. Have you not found yourself to be happy without a conscious or unconscious cause? Then you are in communion with all nature and man. But unfortunately you are so occupied with your own thoughts and problems, envies and fears, that you are incommunicado; this isolating process prevents you from knowing your wife or your husband and child; you are sheltering behind a wall of your own making, and without breaking down these walls there can be no communion, no love. Without love, to become chaste, to become a celibate is unchaste. Where there is love there is chastity, there is incorruptibility.</p>
<p>Questioner: I have been listening to what you have been saying, and I feel to carry out your teachings I must renounce the world I live in.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: You cannot live in isolation; to exist is to be related. You can live in isolation only in an asylum. You can live happily with the world only when you are not of the world, involved in its worldliness. The world is made up of things, of relationship, and of ideas and the values you have given to them. These valuations cause conflict, and from this misery you desire to escape, which is called renunciation. You may give up your house but you will be attached to your wife; you may renounce your wife but you will cling to idea, to belief. Wrong valuation breeds conflict, confusion, and misery. Only right valuation or understanding of property, of name, of belief puts an end to sorrow.</p>
<p>To understand yourself is to understand the giver of values. Without understanding yourself, there is no renunciation of the world; without self-knowledge there can be only escape, called renunciation, which gives birth to endless problems and miseries. It is like a stupid man renouncing stupidity but he is still stupid; his very attempt to become clever is still stupid. If he becomes aware of what is stupidity, which is himself, then surely he will understand greatly. In understanding what is, is the beginning of wisdom; the awareness of what is opens the door to reality. But escape leads to illusion and not to the discovery of that which is the real. To give right value to property, to relationship, to ideas is arduous. To escape through renunciation is comparatively easy, and to build a wall of self-enclosing isolation does not lead to happiness. Property has a meaning only according to your valuation. If you are inwardly insufficient, empty, then property becomes enormously important, from which arises the problem of attachment and renunciation. All psychological valuation is the outcome of the craving for self-expansion; this self-expansion process is to cover up this inward poverty, and so the activities of the self are in their very nature an escape, causing conflict, confusion, and sorrow. Happiness lies in understanding the full meaning of what is and not in running away into isolation.</p>
<p>Questioner: Life hurls at us one problem after another. Will the state of awareness of which you speak enable one to understand and dissolve, once and for all, the whole question of problems at one stroke, or have they to be dissolved one after another?</p>
<p>I feel certain deep urges which need to be disciplined. What is the best way of disciplining?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: If the creator of problems is not understood, then problems are inevitable; if he is deeply and fully comprehended, then problems will cease, or as they arise are understood immediately and dissolved. To merely deal with the symptoms without understanding the cause does not bring about a cure, so to be concerned only with problems without understanding the creator of them is to be in constant conflict. The thinker is the creator of problems, and he resists or disciplines his thoughts in order to meet what he has created. Discipline exists only as a measure of resistance; otherwise thought is not disciplined. If through discipline, habits and self-enclosures are brought about, then fear and anxiety are warded off and achievement and success are gained. Discipline, which is resistance, comes into being when there is no understanding. In understanding a problem, the problem ceases to be, and not in resisting it. If you understand the cause of arrogance and its effect, then you do not have to discipline against it. The disciplining against arrogance is the pride of becoming. So to understand what is is strenuous; to understand what is, which is arrogance, there must be no distraction, the distraction of the conflict of its opposite, humility. To understand, there must be complete concentration on what is, concentration which is not exclusive. The discipline against temptation is the building up of resistance, and resistance is violence, which is death. This self-enclosing process of discipline prevents understanding and communion. A man disciplined in righteousness has no love, for he is enclosing himself within the walls of his becoming. Awareness of the process and of the meaning of discipline brings about intelligence, and that which is intelligent is never resisting, but pliable and swift. That which is pliable is enduring.</p>
<p>Now, let us consider the other question: whether problems are to be solved one after another as they arise, or whether it is possible to uproot the cause of all problems. If the maker of problems can be fully understood, then the conflict and sorrow of problems will cease. The creator of problems is the thinker, is it not? Problems do not exist apart from the thinker. Is the thinker separate from his problems? Is the thinker separate from his thoughts? If he is separate, then problems will continue indefinitely; if he is not, then there is a possibility of putting an end to all psychological problems. Does not the thinker separate himself from his thoughts, from his problems, in order to resist or protect himself from all change, while transforming his thoughts or grappling with his problems? Is this not a cunning trick, an illusion on the part of the thinker to safeguard himself? But if the thinker is the thought, is the problem, inseparable, then he, the maker of problems, can begin to dissolve himself and not be concerned with the change of thought, with the solution of the problem.</p>
<p>Now, if you are aware, you will observe that the thinker has separated from his thought, and on this your philosophies, your sacred books, and beliefs are based. There are only thoughts and not the thinker of thoughts; put aside the qualities of the thinker, his thoughts, where is the thinker? The thinker is not. Set aside the qualities of the self, memory and his attributes, and so on, where is the self? But if you assert that the self is not the thinker but some other entity beyond and above him, he is still the thinker, only you have pushed the thinker further away, but he is still within the field of thought.</p>
<p>Now, why does the thinker separate himself from his thoughts, his problems? He perceives that thoughts are transient, modified according to environmental influences, that he can shape his thoughts according to the pattern of craving. Since he is seeking permanency, he himself becomes the permanent entity, giving himself continuity. How does the thinker come into being? Obviously through craving. Craving is the outcome of perception, contact, sensation, desire, identification, the 'me' and the 'mine'. The thinker is the product of desire, and having produced the 'I' the 'me', then the 'I' the thinker, separates himself from his thoughts, feelings, and actions. He remains in the illusion of permanency, brooding over his thoughts and problems. So as long as the thinker is separate from his thoughts, ever-increasing problems will continue. When the thinker is the thought, then what happens? Then the thinker himself is undergoing a transformation, a radical, fundamental transformation. This, as I have said, is right meditation. The passive, yet alert, awareness of the ways of the thinker brings self-knowledge. With self-knowledge there is the beginning of meditation. Meditation is the ending of thought, in which the continuance of the thinker ceases. The thinker, in disciplining his thought from which he has separated himself, gives continuity to himself through property, family, through knowledge and belief. Problems will continue as long as the thinker separates himself from his thoughts. When there is an awareness of the total process, then only is there self-knowledge; self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom. Time, as memory, ceases only through self-knowledge.</p>
