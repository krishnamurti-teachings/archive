<p>I am going to try this morning, as an experiment, to repeat what I have said in ideas, not consecutive ideas, but explain completely each idea. You know, we are accustomed to consecutive reasoning and to consecutive ideas put together as a lecture, consequentially leading until we come to a climax. I am not going to do that this morning. I am going to take idea by idea, which I have talked about, and deal with it completely. So don’t look for a sequence. Don’t say this arises from this and that comes from that. I don’t know that I am going to succeed but I will try.</p>
<p>You know that it is only a thing that is full of tension that can give a right note, like a violin string that is really tuned to its right pitch will give its right tone. So likewise, a mind and a heart that are truly in right tension can respond to any experience fully. To understand the full significance of an experience you must give your whole attention to it, undivided. There must be acute sensitiveness; your whole being must be there when that experience takes place.</p>
<p>Thus there comes, when there is true tension, a decision. Now, some of you have heard me over and over again, because there has not been this tension at all. You have not decided - not the decision of choice but the decision of understanding. For instance, I have talked about security. Until you are willing to lose that security, there is no decision. When you hear and you really understand the falseness of security, there is, out of that tension, a corresponding note which is decision, which is, “I have understood,” therefore you act. That is a true decision without effort, which cannot take place if you want security and at the same time agree intellectually with me. So you can never have a decision, clear, natural, spontaneous, because there is not the full tension of mind and heart all the time.</p>
<p>Now we are afraid to lose - lose our life, our possessions, our qualities, our virtues - because we say we have accumulated, we have suffered, history has given us culture for so many generations. I have accumulated, my father has left it, how can I get rid of it, how can I leave it, how can I give it away?</p>
<p>So, until you lose everything, until you lose the very thing that you have struggled for through centuries, you will rely on time, because your mind is occupied all the time with gain - and hence suffering. So we say, “I will not lose, but I will accumulate, accumulate experiences.” And you will say to yourself, “Intelligence comes through accumulation of experience.” To me, time does not give intelligence, nor does experience give you intelligence. You can have a dozen experiences, but out of that there is not the flower of understanding. You can know that by watching people. And you are the same because you are looking to accumulation, not to complete denudation, loss of everything, of your own life. When you are prepared to do that, then there is true decision.</p>
<p>So, we have accumulated so much - I see this is becoming a regular consequential talk; sorry, it doesn’t matter! - we have made great effort in accumulating, which have become our hindrances. First of all, the idea of choice. That is what we have learned, as we say, “Through accumulation I can learn, therefore let me choose.” So you begin to differentiate your action, your choice, between the essential and the unessential. You choose this as opposed to that, and hence the very thing that you have chosen gives vitality to that which you have left. Think it over. You say, “This is evil, and I will go to the good.” You have chosen the good, so you have given vitality to the evil from which you have got away. But if you understood the very thing from which you are running away you would be free from both, like the man who is pursuing courage, therefore he gives vitality to fear. To put it differently: where there is choice, and out of that a decision, such decision must create another opposite. And this will exist so long as your mind is looking to accumulation, whether of things or of virtues. Do not say, “I am against virtues,” which is the opposite. I say: A man who is pursuing virtue is not virtuous, because he does not know what it is. Now we say a man is of character, as opposed to no character; a man is good as opposed to evil. So he is caught in opposites and trading opposites and giving vitality to that which he has left. But if a man were free from that in which he is caught, whatever it is, through understanding, he would be free from all of them. He is neither good nor bad. It is something more exquisite, something much more vital, dynamic, free like the wind.</p>
<p>So, where action is born of choice there must be a hindrance, and life cannot flow through it naturally, spontaneously. Which does not mean that you shall do the opposite. I am sorry to all the time emphasize this, but this is what has been understood by people who want to have time. It is the same thing with regard to knowledge.</p>
<p>Then there is the other hindrance of consistency. Your minds are trained to be consistent; your whole life, your conduct, is to be consistent. I am going to explain what I mean, which again, please bear in mind, is not that you must not be consistent. Consistency is memory. Which means that when you have partially understood a thing, that has given you a principle or an idea to which you are being consistent. For instance, you have an idea of what right conduct is, which you have learned, and you are being consistent throughout your life to that particular idea. Your memory is pushing you back to a principle which you have established, and to which you consistently behave. Now, to me, that is a hindrance because it involves time, whereas if you meet that experience or that incident or that person completely each time, you will no longer be consistent, consistent to a principle. Out of this consistency there is born self-discipline, which twists the <i>now</i>, the present. That is the whole process of what we call self-discipline. We want to twist the <i>now</i>, the present, to a certain formula which you have learned through experience, and that twisting process we call self-discipline. You establish an idea from an incident, from an experience, which has become a memory to which you will try to be consistent, and whatever you meet in the present you twist according to that consistency. This is what you call discipline, or following a system, finding a method. You have a mental picture, an idea or a method, invented by another, and because you want to gain, search out a reward for your action, which is born of fear. You are being consistent to that memory, not to understanding. In understanding there is never consistency, there is pliability - which does not mean the opposite.</p>
<p>Then there is the hindrance of security. Please follow this. I am leading up to something, not as a lecture. I want to show awareness without effort. We search out security because in security, in things, in money, in possession, in lands, in houses, in virtues, in this idea of being safe - in one word, <i>security</i> - we hope to derive happiness, strength from that security because we are insecure in ourselves. We are empty, therefore we say, “If I have money,” or, “If I have land,” or, “If I have power, there is sustenance, so let me accumulate.” You are merely looking to power, to virtue, to possessions, to comfort, to give you vitality to battle with life. Being aware of your own littleness, of your own empty shallowness, you accumulate these things around you in the hope that you can smother, dry out that shallow stream of loneliness. To me this is false.</p>
<p>The more and more you look to security, the greater and greater that emptiness becomes. The more and more you accumulate wealth, power, possessions, lands, virtues, the more shallow your thoughts and emotions. So all these hindrances - conformity, authority, which is included in security - give vitality to that consciousness which you call ‘I’ consciousness. These various bundles of hindrances go to create that ‘I’, and having created that ‘I’, we think by expanding it more and more that that is progress. Now you come to listen to me and you hear quite the opposite, so you say, “Now I have made the effort to accumulate,” which you have done. You have sought out virtues; you have sought out standards; you have sought out methods; you have sought out, carefully developed, choice, which is merely cunningness; you have sought out possessions, whether earthly things or super-earthly things, such as virtues. So you have made tremendous efforts to accumulate, and when I say these are hindrances you begin to use the same effort to get rid of them. So what have you done? You are merely vitalizing those things which you think you ought to get rid of: security, conformity, consistency, and so on. Please follow this. You have, by trying to get rid of it, given vitality to the very thing you are trying to get rid of. That is, you are acting in choice. You say, “I have accumulated through effort; through effort I must get rid of it.” So, like the man who is eschewing evil and becoming good, he only increases evil. Therefore, a man who says, “These are hindrances, therefore let me fight them, get rid of them,” only increases them, the very same hindrances, only he will give them different names, more sweet-sounding, but in relation it is exactly the same thing from which he is trying to run away.</p>
<p>Now, there is a decision which is choiceless. We have made a tremendous effort through centuries. I feel there is, for me, no effort in this, and I want to help you to find out for yourself how to live without effort. To understand it, you must have followed all that I have said. You have accumulated through centuries and stored in your granaries of mind and heart all kinds of things which to me are rubbish. So don’t go to the opposite and say, “They are rubbish; I am going to get rid of them.” That is what you are doing. You are making an effort to get rid of them, and hence your action is instantly caught up in choice and effort; therefore, there is not a decision without choice. When I talk about security, if you really agree with your mind and heart, then there is no choice about it; a decision is made. But choice exists, which is conflict, when you agree intellectually and your emotions are the other, say, that is, when you are no longer tense.</p>
<p>The majority of you, almost all of you, are in that position. You agree that there cannot be security, with all its implications. You are with me intellectually, but emotionally you are quite the opposite. Don’t say, “I don’t know how to do it.” Don’t say, “I don’t know how I shall live without money.” You will find out. That is the point. The point is, the idea of security, or the falseness of security, must, if you are tense, have given you the right response, intention.</p>
<p>So when you are decided, and in that decision there is intense awareness, once you decide wholly the falseness of conformity, then your actions become fully active, then your actions will reveal if they are conforming. Do you see what I mean? When once you have decided with your whole being the futility of being consistent - because you understand, not because you have heard me, but because you understand what it means - when you have decided, your next action will show if you are conforming, and in that flame of awareness there is not an effort.</p>
<p>Action, then, can be free of its limitation by individuality alone. Now we look to action being freed, that is, mind and heart being freed by something, by a virtue, by a security, by knowledge, by an idea. Action, to be complete, can only exist when you as an individual can discover true values. I don’t know if you are getting all the implications. We have false values and from that we act; we act from the false values that we have accumulated, and we hope through that action to free the mind from false values. I say that mind and heart, which is action, can be freed only when you are truly individual, when you stand alone in right value. That means, you must question every standard that you have, not do the opposite. Until you are truly individual, which is to discover right value, which is eternal, you can only do it - it is not an idea, not self-discipline, not choice, not time - you can only discover right value when there is absolute decision, when you meet everything wholly. Then in you there is a corresponding decision which is not an effort.</p>
<p>You know, I have done this myself, that is why I am talking about it. I have heard people talk about security differently. I have heard people talk about virtue: because, you say, you have suffered, you are tormented, there is so much suffering in the world, choose the essential, which will liberate you. For myself, I have experimented. I have known what suffering is, like everybody else. There is so much suffering, and because I feel and I know - I have found out, I have freed myself from that suffering without effort - I want to tell you how to do it. It is not a method. Because I have freed myself from that suffering which everyone goes through, there is a way of acting without effort. This is what I mean. We make an effort to gain, and after gaining we make an effort not to lose. So we are caught up in this wheel of effort, struggle, conflict, pain, suffering. Realize that effort of any kind is only destructive, like sharpening a pencil: the more and more you sharpen, the less and less pencil with which to write. That is what we have done through generations, with mind and heart, sharpening until we find we have nothing. We say that after having nothing we must accumulate, so we begin again. The effort shows again that there is a craving, because you want to accumulate, to possess. You hear me talk about all this and say, “I must get rid of effort, I must get rid of possession,” and you make an effort. So the whole process is wrong. You must think anew and act intuitively, spontaneously. To act intuitively is to act completely, harmoniously, with the whole of your being, mind and heart.</p>
<p>There is an effortless existence, as the flower lives. There is an eternal thing which cannot be found or come out of effort. But do not say, “I must not make an effort,” which is the opposite. But understand the cause of effort and all opposites will disappear. Some of you have heard, and some of you have understood. Some of you have heard with attention and therefore you have decided, and hence your actions will reveal themselves, whether they are hindered or spontaneous in action. Your own actions will reveal the depth of your own understanding, not born out of effort, choice, and all the rest. Because there is tremendous tension, and because of that tenseness, there is a corresponding reply in your action. That is true awareness. After, decision is action, with full significance, with full awareness, in which all your hindrances are revealed. You know, when you see a hindrance ahead, barbed wire, you don’t fight it, you go round it. When you see an ordinary physical hindrance you pass it by because you understand it is a hindrance. Now you don’t understand it is a hindrance, this craving, this desire to possess power; it is not obvious, you don’t understand it. Therefore you want, and hence the whole gamut of suffering. I say, there is a way out of this, and because I have gone through it I tell you how to do it. That is, meet everything fully, meet all persons, meet all experiences afresh. In that movement of action you will awaken all the past hindrances and thereby be free, and then you will know what immortality is, and then there is that eternal becoming, which is life itself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Are you immortal? In what sense? - as an item in the memory of humanity, or in yourself as a being, perfect, eternal. You speak of immortality as eternal timeless being, yet, within the illusion of time the illusions of death and reincarnation continue. What is the real, vital attitude toward them, as one has to deal with them, even though they be essentially illusions?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As I was trying to explain the other day, as long as the mind is occupied with the idea of continuity and noncontinuity, with duality, it cannot understand this timeless becoming which to me is immortality. Now our minds are occupied with time, that is yesterday, today and tomorrow, and we want to know if, as an individual, we shall continue. Our chief concern when we talk about immortality is whether we shall continue as individuals. The very question, whether you as an individual will continue, arises from this sense of duality. When you say, “Shall I continue?” you imply a distinction and therefore a resistance. So then you ask me, “Is it total annihilation? If the individual does not continue, there must be total annihilation.” I say it is neither of these, and you will never understand what immortality is so long as your mind is occupied with the duality; does the individual continue or is he annihilated? Does he disappear totally?</p>
<p>I say there comes into being a new element, which you cannot understand, if your action is divided into a yesterday, today, and tomorrow. And as most of our action is divided in that manner, the question arises, “Shall I be immortal, are you immortal, are you an incident in history, or do you, as an individual, continue through eternity?” To me, all these questions cannot be answered, because when I answer you will not understand. I can answer it, but it will have no value.</p>
<p>To me, immortality is an infinite becoming, not a growing. That which grows is self-limited consciousness, therefore it has no inherent endurance. But that timeless eternal life, becoming - that is immortal, and to realize that, there cannot be this sense of duality in action.</p>
<p>Now with regard to the question of reincarnation. As I have tried to explain, the ‘I’ is the result of effort, conflict, and choice, and that ‘I’ has no inherent value, has no permanent existence. So to me, whether that lives in time through reincarnation, through a set period, is irrelevant. Whether an illusion can be carried in time, is not the question. When you say, “Is there reincarnation?” that is what you mean, at least that is what I mean. To you it has a very definite meaning - that you as an individual shall go through time. To me, that is not reincarnation, it is the illusion of the T. And you want to know if that illusion can be carried through time until it becomes perfect by growing, by expanding, by accumulating. The very question as to whether you can carry the ‘I’ through time indicates a duality, and hence your very thought regarding it is an illusion. I am not saying whether it is true or not; we are not concerned with that. I am not dodging or trying to avoid the question. You cannot answer categorically “yes” or “no,” because it has no value. You are concerned, if the ‘I’ will be continued. Now I say, that very ‘I’ of which you are conscious, is an illusion. You want to carry that illusion through time, which is opportunity, experience, and we think that by understanding that we shall have understood the whole process of injustice in the world, illness, lack of opportunity, and so on. I say: You will not understand the injustice, lack of opportunity, and all the other things, through understanding an illusion. So, when you ask if there is reincarnation, you are concerning your mind with time, whereas I say that if you free the mind of time, you will know immortality. Not through time or through reincarnation will you find immortality, but in the idea of timelessness you will know it. I hope you see the difference; the one emphasizes time and the other is the absolute understanding of that timelessness.</p>
<p>Now I will tell you a story briefly. A Hindu, a Brahmin, in ancient days was giving away things in sacrifice to the priests and the gods. And his son came often and asked him to whom he was giving away these things. A little later, the son asked, “To whom are you going to give me?” And the father in annoyance, because the boy had been pestering him, told him that he was going to send him to Death. Now a Brahmin, in ancient days, had to fulfill what he said, even though he said it in anger. So he sent him to Death, and while he was sending him, he asked him to visit many shrines, many teachers. At last he arrives at the house of Death, but Death is absent. So he waits until at last Death arrives and apologizes for keeping the Brahmin waiting, because it was the custom that when the host is absent the guest could not eat. So the son did not eat for three days, because the host was absent. So Death apologizes and says that in return for his discourtesy the son can accept three gifts. So the son chooses first to return to his father, and that his father will not be angry with him; secondly he chooses a certain fire ritual which is not important, and lastly he says, “I have listened to many wise men. Some say there is continuance after death and some say there is total annihilation. What do you, Death, who must know, say?” And Death replies, “Do not ask me that question! I will give you power, palaces, riches, amusements, sensation, anything you like, but do not ask me that!” But the boy insists, and so Death says, “I wish all the pupils who come to me were like you.” And Death teaches him what immortality is, never once replying, whether there is continuity or annihilation.</p>
<p>Now, you are all concerned with that question - whether you will exist or not after death. And hence the whole conflict of time, and the whole preoccupation with the division of opportunity, of experience. You will not find immortality through time, which is experience, nor through the multiplication of experiences will you find immortality. There is immortality only when there is this understanding of the cessation of time in action.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>What is really the root cause of our sympathy, pity, compassion for the suffering and pain and sorrow in life, in all its forms? Is this normal to one free of the ego illusion?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I tried to explain this yesterday. I said, “Where there is compassion, there is no suffering.” Do not ask me whether if you see a dog or a horse hurt you should not feel suffering or hurt. There are two ways of looking at it. Either you are hurt because you want or you possess, or else because it is a beautiful thing; because it is life itself, and therefore you are not hurt, but awakened to the cruelty. When you see a beautiful thing spoiled, you are not hurt, you are shocked. That created thing is a natural thing of life itself, and when that is despoiled, then your natural sympathies are awakened instantaneously, spontaneously. In that there is no ego-consciousness, at least from my point of view. But when we possess, and in that object which we possess there is pain, we also suffer. That is, if my friend is ill, or my wife, or child, I suffer because there is an emptiness in us. So, where there is reliance on another, in that there is ever suffering, and we mistake that for compassion. To me, it is not compassion. We have a peculiar idea of compassion. We think that God, who is all-compassionate, will save us from our suffering. Our suffering is created from our own illusion, and no one is going to save you except yourself. So, where there is true compassion, there is no suffering. Compassion is spontaneous, natural; but where there is possession of any kind, there arises that consciousness of emptiness and we try to run away from that emptiness. So when that person whom we possess is taken away or is hurt or is suffering, then we ourselves suffer.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>If love of power is the fundamental craving in us, do you know the way by which we can become utterly free of it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am going to talk about that presently. And there is the other question which was asked, “Why do we fear death and what is the way of freeing ourselves from that fear of death?”</p>
<p>Someone dies, your brother, wife, child, or husband, and you suffer. This is a common event of life, and why do we suffer so intensely? Because we have been relying on that person to complement us. When that person dies, we come to a full consciousness of loneliness; we become fully aware of our emptiness. Before, we have tried to hide it, to compensate, to run away through the possession of another. Becoming conscious of that emptiness which we call death or the losing of another, then to escape from that suffering, what is it we do? We want happiness, to escape from that sorrow, or to have the return of the loved one. Please follow this, because that is what we are doing. When we suffer there is an immediate desire to appease that suffering. Where there is want there is no discernment, because the moment you want to satisfy that sorrow you accept any gift that is offered you in order to cover up your sorrow. You accept the gift of consolation, the gift of reincarnation, the gift of a hereafter, or a heaven, or of unity in the One Life. You accept, in your sorrow, the gifts of others, and therefore diminish your sorrow, hide it, put it away, and hence what you have accepted creates blindness. When you are really in acute sorrow then you are questioning, then, in that acuteness, in that alertness, instead of subjugating it, dulling it, or hiding it away, you no longer try to escape from it. When you are no longer wanting more happiness or consolation, then the acuteness of your sorrow will show you the true cause of suffering or the true cause of the fear of death.</p>
<p>Someone dies and you suffer, and you want that person back. And so you turn to the idea of reincarnation, of seances. What has happened? You are merely dulling the mind which has awakened to loneliness, in which there is sorrow; you are merely running away from it. But if you inquire what is the cause of suffering, you will come to it, when you really examine, when you are really awake to all the gifts which people offer, and therefore discern their true value. Then you will find out the true cause, which is loneliness.</p>
<p>Where there is want there is loneliness. Wanting creates loneliness, and wanting is the cause. But to you, it is not the cause, it is only intellectual theory. You will find out the cause, and therefore be free of this fear of death, when in the moment of acute suffering you become fully conscious of everything that is offered as consolation. Then you will know whether you are escaping, whether you are seeking consolation or comfort, and so in the very offering of that gift you will know its full significance, and then your mind is forced to face the cause naturally.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>In your talk of the 11th August you said that the fullness and ecstasy of life is discovered “not through action, hut in the action itself whatever it be - your earning of money, your ceremonies, your sexual problems. “ As this has led to much confusion in the minds of some of us who attended the discussion meeting, will you kindly further clarify your statement? What do you mean by the discovery of ecstasy of life in the sexual action or in the ceremony itself?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Look here, my friends, those of you who want to do ceremonies, why discuss it? A person who wants to play the piano does not discuss about it. It is only the hypocritical mind which wants to find a loophole in what I am saying to justify his actions. He puts out this question constantly. Please do not look round at your ceremonialist friends; we are all doing it in a different way in ourselves. It may not be with regard to ceremonies, it may be with regard to earning money, or to sex, or to the accumulation of things which give us power. I have said what I mean with regard to ceremonies quite clearly. I think they are an illusion, that inherently they have no value. But to find out for yourself, do not discuss about it. Find out if your reason and your heart are really in harmony in what you are doing. To find out if they are in harmony, they must both be ripe. That is the difficulty. To find out if they are in harmony, do not hold on to things. If you are performing ceremonies, let it go for a day, or a week, or a year. I am not asking you to do this, but if you want to find out and experiment as to whether you are acting truly in harmony, let it go; and at the end of the year see if you really need it. But do not say, “Other people need it and for their sake I must do it.” That shows a hypocritical mind. What is a poison to you is also poison to another; what is valueless to you is valueless to another. Why pass on that which is useless for you to another? We do it because it gives us assurance, power, vanity, like a person who has decorations from the government. I assure you there is not much difference between these ceremonies and the ceremonies of courts and kings. I am awfully sorry but this is my opinion. Where unrighteousness is rampant all these things exist. Where there is unnaturalness, which is fear, all these things exist.</p>
<p>Please, I have said my last say with regard to ceremonies. We go over and over and over again every year and I am not going to answer it any more. I may answer it to those who hear it for the first time, but not to the accustomed ear, to the man who has already made up his mind to do what he wants to do, and who wants my confirmation. Why ask me? If you want to do something, if you think it is right, do it! You will find out. But to find out, be open about it, be frank, not hypocritical. Do not base your actions on authority. Do not perform ceremonies, because someone has said, “There is power in ceremonies,” or because you yourself get a certain stimulation and think it is spiritual, divine. To me, there is no external spiritual power, nor that subjective thing which we call the ‘I’ or the higher self from which we derive power. Both are sensation. And when the mind is free from both the object and the subject, then you will know what is; then you will know that ecstasy of living in which there is no fear.</p>
