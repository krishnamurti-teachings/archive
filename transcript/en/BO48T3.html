<p>Questioner: What are the real causes of Mahatma Gandhi's untimely death?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: You must approach the question either as a personal loss or as one of the events in the world crisis. If it is a personal loss, then the significance has to be understood. There is in most people the tendency to identify oneself with something greater, whether it is a person, the nation, or an idea. This craving for identification with a person or with an idea is an indication of one's own poverty of being. The identification with a person brings a sense of personal loss when anything happens to that person. Similarly, when there is an identification with a nation or a group, and when that nation is conquered or becomes a conqueror, there is depression or elation. This desire to identify exists, for in oneself one is empty, shallow, without substance, and by identifying oneself with a country, with a leader, with a group, one becomes something, one is something. This identification leads to extremes of thoughtlessness and ruthlessness. If you identify yourself with a person, with a group of people, then you are responsible for any calamity that may happen to that person or to that group. Through this identification, exploitation comes into being.</p>
<p>What are the causes that have brought about this assassination? Each one is responsible for what is happening in the world at the present time. The various incidents that are taking place at the present time are not unrelated incidents but related. The real cause of this murder lies in you. The real cause is you. Because you are communalistic, you encourage the spirit of violence, of division, of caste, of ideology. Obviously, you are responsible and it is foolish merely to blame the murderer. You have all contributed to the murder.</p>
<p>It is inevitable when a so-called nation is made up of separate groups, each seeking power, position, and authority; then, it is bound to produce not one man's death but thousands. Similarly, organized religion with its dogma and belief will inevitably produce conflict and confusion. When belief becomes stronger than affection, then there is antagonism between man and man - belief in ideology, in patriotism, and so on. In how many different ways each one tries to isolate oneself from another. This isolation is the real cause of strife and misery.</p>
<p>This assassination is an indication of the present trend in the world's affairs. Wrong means for a right end is justified; ruthlessness as a means to world peace is morally encouraged; war is justified because it will bring about peace. Justification of evil has become a necessity, which makes for an unprecedented crisis in man's relation to man. The sacrifice of the present is another indication of man's ruthlessness to man. This liquidation of the present human life for a future utopia is another indication of the utter ruthlessness that comes when there is identification with an ideology. The sacrifice of the present to the future is a sacrifice to darkness because the future is uncertain and cannot be predicted. ''To save man, man must be killed'' is the greatest form of illusion. For a future security, your present security is denied. Surely, only in the present and not in the future lies understanding. Comprehension is in the now and not in the tomorrow.</p>
<p>The justification of evil and the sacrifice of the present for the unpredictable future are the two tendencies that are making the world crisis of an extraordinary character. Does this not prevent love between man and man? Without love there is no solution for any problem. Without love there can be no transformation of the present chaos. The worship of the intellect cannot bring about a solution to our miseries, but only affection, love, can bring happiness to man. When the intellect becomes supreme, the heart is empty. You will fill it with the things of the intellect and so allow cunning and ruthlessness, deceit and antagonism to prevail.</p>
<p>Since you are responsible for the world crisis and for the various incidents in this crisis, you have to radically transform yourself. For this transformation you must be aware of your ways of thinking, feeling, and acting. Through this awareness, earnestness and serious intention come into being. Mere outward transformation will not bring about happiness to you. Only when there is an inward revolution, a psychological transformation, only then can there be peace and happiness in you and so in the world.</p>
<p>Questioner: Can we realize the truth of what you are speaking immediately, without any previous preparation?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: To put the problem differently, can you understand directly or comprehend a problem immediately? In understanding what is, truth comes into being. It is truth that gives freedom, and not the mere analysis of the problem, nor the mere search after the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>Life is, is it not, a series of challenges and responses. If your response to a challenge is conditioned, then that challenge, not being understood, leaves its mark, its residue, which further strengthens the conditioning. So, there is constant residual memory, accumulation, scars, which prevent the understanding of the new. The question is whether one can understand a problem so completely that it leaves no residual memory, for it is the memory that prevents the understanding of truth. For truth to come into being, mind must be free from the scars of yesterday. Since every problem is new, only a fresh, unscarred mind can understand it. A problem which you have had yesterday, for example, has undergone a change today; and when you meet it, your mind must equally have undergone a transformation so as to meet it anew. So, to understand the truth of a problem, you must come to it afresh, without the scars of yesterday. To be free from yesterday's memory, each experience must be completely understood. It is the incomplete experience that leaves memories, and through the screen of these memories the new cannot be understood.</p>
<p>A problem can be understood immediately, and the truth of it seen directly, when the mind is not interposing between the problem and yourself the various screens of escapes, such as the desire for a comforting answer, a gratifying conclusion, a repetitive intention. Understanding comes when the mind is not burdened with the past, when the mind is still. This stillness is not the product of compulsion, of discipline, of a practice, but it comes into being when you are directly in relationship to the problem itself.</p>
<p>To perceive truth does not need preparation. Preparation implies time, and time is not the means to the understanding of truth. Time is continuity, and truth is timeless. Understanding is noncontinuous; it is from moment to moment. Understanding is not cumulative. It is this open quality that is necessary for immediate understanding, unclouded by theories, fears, and conclusions. Only then is there communion. When the mind and heart are open, then only can truth come into being.</p>
<p>Questioner: Does Gandhiji continue to exist today?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: You want to know the truth of continuity. This indirect question regarding Gandhiji's continuity is an inquiry about your own continuity. Most of you probably believe in reincarnation and continuity. So, your belief is preventing you from finding the truth of this question. We will experiment to find the truth of this matter directly, now and not tomorrow. To invite the truth concerning continuity, you must put away your beliefs. Even though you may have proofs of continuity, they are still in the field of thought; the mind can fabricate and deceive itself. So, to find the truth of this challenge, you must come to it afresh, with a mind that is unburdened. For truth to come into being, all these impediments of the mind, the creations of the mind, must be set aside. When the mind is clouded with anxiety, hope, with the longing for continuity, it is incapable of understanding. To understand, you have to be aware of the various hindrances, now, that prevent the mind from receiving truth.</p>
<p>Now, what is continuity? Either there is continuity for the spiritual entity or for memory. Either you are a spiritual entity or merely a bundle of memory. This memory gives itself continuity through experience. If you are a spiritual entity, that entity is timeless and so it has no continuity; it is not in the net of the past, the present, and the future; for that which is real, spiritual, cannot be thought of, formulated, caught in the net of time. It cannot evolve, it cannot progress or grow: it cannot become. Since you are thinking in terms of becoming, continuing, you are not a spiritual entity. If you are a spiritual entity, then death and life are one. Then there is immortality. If you are a spiritual entity, then you will not be concerned with death, nor with becoming, and the complications of acquisitiveness and envy. But, since you are concerned with these things, you may not quibble with the assertion that you are a spiritual entity, which implies a state of being in which time is not. Since you crave for continuity, you are concerned with death, so you are not a spiritual entity.</p>
<p>So, we can put aside the belief that you are a spiritual entity and concern ourselves with the desire for continuity. What is that continuity? Obviously, it is memory identified with property, name, relationship, and idea. If you had no memory of yesterday, then things would have very little significance. You are seeking continuity and establishing it through property, through family, through idea. This continuity is the 'me', the 'I'. You want to know if this 'me' continues. Now, what is this 'me'? Is it not the name, the qualities, your bank account if you have one, your position, your character, your idiosyncrasies, and so on? All this is memory, is it not? I am stating what actually is and not dealing with theories and speculations. We must know the truth of this, and it is truth that liberates and not theories and explanations concerning continuity.</p>
<p>What causes continuity? Obviously, identified memory. How did this memory come into being? There is perception, contact, sensation, desire, and identification; from these arise the idea of me and mine. You perceive a car and then contact it; you have the sensation and then the desire to possess it. So, the 'me' is the residue of memory. However much this memory may divide itself into the higher and lower self, this division is still within the field of memory, and therefore it is not true. Memory is incomplete understanding. Have you not noticed that when you understand something completely, wholly, the memory of it has faded away?</p>
<p>Love is not memory. It is not a state of being. It is not a continuity. There is a continuity when there is sensation and memory, which is not love. So, continuity is memory. Through identification, the various separate and broken memories are given a continuity.</p>
<p>Through continuity, is there renewal? The 'me' continues from memory to memory, the 'me' which has divided itself into the high and the low. This whole process of identification is the 'me' with its continuity through memory. Now, will this continuity bring a renewal? Will continuity bring the understanding of truth? Certainly not. That which continues has no renewal. That which was of yesterday, though modified today, cannot have freshness, newness. Memory can only renew itself, and this renewal through memory is not the renewal of a new birth. So, continuity of memory is not a renewal. There is renewal only when there is an ending. There is a new birth only when there is death to yesterday, to the identified memory. You will continue, obviously, as long as there is identified memory, but in this continuity there is no renewal.</p>
<p>Memory is the product of time, and through time the timeless cannot be. There must be death, an ending, for the real to be - death to acquisition, to memory. There is continuity when thought is identified, and that continuity can never be open to the real. Only when there is death from moment to moment, an ending of psychological memory, then only is there renewal, a rebirth. Through the process of time, through identified memory, reality can never be. Only when thought, which is the product of time, ceases - then only is there the real.</p>
