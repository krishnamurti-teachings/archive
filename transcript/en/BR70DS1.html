<p>Krishnamurti: Do you know what is happening in the world? - the hijacking, the deception, outright lying, revolt, and the chaos and the misery in India. When you read about it, what does it mean to you? Or don't you read about it - are you not aware of what is happening?</p>
<p>Questioner: A lot of it is very sad.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: What do you mean by that word?</p>
<p>Questioner: Some people are dominating others and hurting lots of people.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: But that has been going on for centuries, hasn't it? - all history is that. What do you think of it?</p>
<p>Questioner: It doesn't really affect me.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Why do you say it doesn't affect you?</p>
<p>Questioner: I see people getting killed on television. I look at it and I don't realize that those are people getting killed.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: What part do you play in all that?</p>
<p>Questioner: I'm not part of it.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Then what is your relationship to it? Is it something that is happening ``over there'', in Jordan, in America?</p>
<p>Questioner: Sometimes it hits home and I can feel what those people are feeling.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Do you feel that one must change all this, or that you can't do anything about it? What is your relationship to the world? Is it an awareness of the extraordinary things that are going on technologically and the appalling inefficiency of man to meet that technological advance? What is your relationship to the confusion that man is producing all round the world?</p>
<p>Questioner: As long as we are confused we are contributing to the confusion.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: I understand that, but what do you feel about it? What is your innermost response to all this?</p>
<p>Questioner: I feel frustrated and angry that all this is happening. I have reactions to it; I see things which are wrong and I get hostile.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: And then what? You see, when you leave here, go on to university or through college, what part are you going to play in it all? Will you just fit into the machinery of it? What's going to become of you in relation to the world? Or are you not interested in that at present? You may say, ``I'm too young to consider all this, I'll have a good time and enjoy life while I can; later on I will think about it.'' Or do you feel that this is a preparation, a commencement of what it is going to be when you grow older? One can revolt now and take drugs or not, this or that - but when you are twenty or twenty-five you will get married. Will you fit into all this? If you don't fit in, what are you going to do? If you are antagonistic to the system, to what is happening - not hypocritical but actually in revolt - can you pretend that you don't really feel the appallingness of all this? What is your response?</p>
<p>Don't you consider what you are going to be at all? Get married and settle down? - if that is the end result, then what is education? Is it to help you to get settled down in life in this system? I have heard many students in India, when asked, ``What are you going to do?'' reply, ``Oh, Sir, my father wants me to be an engineer, my father wishes me to be a doctor, we need doctors. I want to help India through becoming an efficient engineer.'' The majority of them think in terms of a professional career, they want to help the backward country, do social work. Is that what you are all going to do? Are you all asleep?</p>
<p>I think that's where the sadness lies, not in what the world is.</p>
<p>The world is that way, deceptive, the deceiving politicians, the money-minded - all that. If you are not properly educated you'll just slip into it. So what do you think is education? Is it to help you to fit into the mechanism of the present order, or disorder, of things or do you think it should be something else? If it is something else, what is it that you want?</p>
<p>Questioner: It's just a learning process.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: What do you mean by learning?</p>
<p>Questioner: Finding out about things around you and in you.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Are you doing it?</p>
<p>Questioner: Yes.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Do you really want to learn?</p>
<p>Questioner: Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Be terribly serious - don't let's talk easily, glibly. Do you know what it means to learn?</p>
<p>Questioner: To find out as much as one can about whatever it is - about everything.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Is that what you mean by ``learn''? - to find out? You can pick up an encyclopaedia; you can find out everything there.</p>
<p>Questioner: That only encompasses the theoretical side.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Then what do you mean by learning?</p>
<p>Questioner: Finding out something and being able to deal with it, cope with it, and possibly even use it.</p>
