<p>There is an art in listening. Most of us are accustomed to translate what is being said, or interpret it according to our conditioning, background, tradition, and so on. Is it not possible to listen to what is being said, as though we were listening to music, to a song? Are you interpreting music when you are listening to it? You are listening to the silence between two notes; you are attentive yet sufficiently relaxed, sufficiently focused to follow the swift movement of music.</p>
<p>Right communion exists only when there is love; there is understanding at the same time, on the same level, without translation and interpretation, when there is love; it is rare to find such complete understanding, for such love is equally rare. But we meet on different levels, at different times, and so communication becomes extremely difficult. Here, what we are trying to do is not only to listen rightly, but also to be creative. To listen not merely to the words, but, without denying, to experiment with what is being said as though you were following alertly and yet silently. But we do not know how to listen, how to observe the new, and what we hear we put in the old forms. We put new wine in old bottles, and the old bottles burst. By putting the new into old terminologies, the flavor of the new is destroyed. We do not approach experiences anew; we come to it with the burden of the past, which only strengthens the past. Love is ever new, ever renewing itself. There is a renewal, a newness for a man of understanding, for he is not caught in a pattern of thought, in interpretation. It would be greatly worthwhile if we could listen with that peculiar quality of creative attention, meeting the new without the burden of the past. As I said, a truth that is repeated ceases to be the truth; if you merely hear it, it is a repetition and so ceases to be the truth, even though you guide it along the familiar channels of thought. If you listen with creative understanding, which is not interpretation, then it is truth which you understand, and it is truth that gives freedom, that gives happiness. We shall miss that happiness, that creative joy, if we translate the new according to old formulas. There can be happiness only when the mind is capable of receiving the new; as the mind is the result of the past, it is extremely arduous to be rid of the old. You must have listened to the song of the bird at early dawn; it is new, incomparable, lovely; your mind is fresh, untroubled by the day's activities, and so is capable of receiving the new, though the song is as old as the hills.</p>
<p>Please listen to what is being said as though you were hearing it for the first time, and you will perceive a curious thing taking place in  you; happiness is not something that is old, but it is a constant renewal of itself.</p>
<p>As I said last week, when happiness is sought through a thing made by the hand or by the mind, the thing itself becomes far more important than happiness; happiness then is merely gratification, which is always impermanent. There is happiness when the process of becoming happy is understood, which is what each one is trying to do - to become happy. We are trying to become clever, to become happy, to become virtuous. If we can understand being and becoming, which are two different states, then perhaps we will be aware of happiness. Being and becoming are two wholly different states. Becoming is continuous, and that which is continuous is always binding. Relationship is binding if it is merely continuous; what is continuous is repetitive, a mere habit. When it ceases to be continuous, there is a new quality in relationship. If you go into it, there will be seen that where there is continuity, a becoming, thought moving from one continuity to another, there is always bondage and pain. Without understanding continuity, there is no being. You never say to yourself, ''I will become happy.'' Being can only be understood when becoming ceases.</p>
<p>Virtue gives freedom. Have you not observed the unvirtuous? How stupid he is, how miserable, how he is caught in the net of his own making. He is happy who is virtuous, and he is free; he is not becoming, but is. There can be freedom only in virtue; it gives order, it brings clarity and freedom from strife. But a man who is not virtuous is disorderly, confused, and in conflict. Virtue is not an end in itself, but its yield is freedom, in which alone reality can take place. But when virtue is used as a means of becoming, then virtue ceases. Being and becoming virtuous are two wholly different states. Virtue is understanding, but becoming virtuous is to continue in ignorance. That which you understand brings freedom; that which you do not brings conflict, confusion, antagonism. When you understand, then there is virtue. Does understanding come by effort, or must there be a state in which effort has ceased for understanding to be? If I desire to understand what you are saying, must I make an effort to listen? Effort exists when there are distractions; distractions are more interesting than listening to you. Not being interested in what you are saying, I have to make an effort not to be distracted in order to listen to you. Where there is earnestness there is communion, communication without effort. Effort is distraction. Now you are listening to me without effort; when you make effort you cease to understand. When you see a painting, do you make an effort to understand? You have to make an effort to criticize it, to compare it, to find out who painted it. But if you want to understand it, you sit quietly with it; in that quietness, without distraction, you understand its permeating beauty. So virtue is where there is no effort to become. But since our whole existence is based on effort, we must discover its true significance, the incessant conflict to become. Consciously or unconsciously, we are occupied always with becoming and its joys and pains. Is this striving inevitable, and what for? What do we mean by making an effort? Does it not mean to become something other than what is? Being stupid, I strive to become clever. Can stupidity ever become intelligence, or must stupidity cease for intelligence to be? If we can understand this question, then we shall understand the significance of making effort, of striving.</p>
<p>We are afraid to face what is; we are afraid to understand what is, and so we are ever striving to transform, modify, or change what is. A rose is not striving to be other than what it is; in this very being there is creation. It has no other conflict than the natural struggle to live. With us there is not only the natural struggle to live - food, clothes, and shelter - but there is constant effort to transform what is.  In understanding what is, there is creation. To understand what is is very arduous, for thought is distracting itself from what is; it is ever transforming what is into something. Religion and education are based on this idea that what is must be changed, modified. You are this and you must become that; you are greedy and you must become nongreedy, and so strive, strain, and struggle. To understand what is needs no striving. Greed ceases only when you understand it, and not when you strive to become nongreedy. But to understand what is, greed, you must give your whole undivided attention, be significantly aware of its extensional value. There is no understanding of what is if you are concerned with distraction, which is the transformation of what is. Greed can never become nongreedy; only when greed ceases is there virtue; stupidity can never become intelligence. Only when stupidity is recognized as stupidity is there the beginning of intelligence, but to strive after intelligence is to be still stupid.</p>
<p>Is effort necessary to understand what is? Effort is distraction, distraction from what is. As our tendency, spiritually and socially, is based on the transformation of what is, this desire to change has in itself become a distraction; we spend our energies in this transformation, which requires effort. We do not understand what is, and yet we are attempting to change what is through discipline, through compulsion, and so on. How can you transform what is without understanding it? To understand what is there must be no condemnation, no justification, no suppression or distortion. Suppression and control do not bring understanding; suppression and discipline are a distraction from what is. If we spent the distracting energy of changing what is in understanding what is, we would find there is a radical transformation of what is. Understanding comes only when there is no strife, no distraction; only when there is quietness, only when there is no striving to be other than what is.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is the difference between introspection and awareness?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: There is introspection when there is the action of the self to change itself, to modify itself, to transform itself. In this process there is always condemnation, justification, identification. I am greedy, which is wrong, and I must become nongreedy; I am angry but I must become peaceful. Introspection is a tyrannical process, leading nowhere. There is a continuity in introspection which becomes a bondage, an impediment to understanding. Every experience is translated according to the pattern of the self, which is ever examining, analyzing, interpreting, putting aside those things which are painful and guarding those which are pleasurable. Introspection is a constant struggle to change what is.</p>
<p>Awareness is the complete recognition of what is and so the understanding of what is. There is no understanding when there is condemnation; there is understanding with passive awareness, with silent observation, then what is begins to unfold itself. What is the response of a man of introspection when he is conscious of greed? Either of condemnation or of identification: if it is painful he attempts to change it, and if it is pleasurable, he pursues it. The response is one of justification or of condemnation; he is ever translating what is in terms of becoming. In the strife of becoming and not becoming we are confused and weary. The introspective action is residual; the action springs always from the residue, the memory of yesterday. In the man of awareness there is no residual response. He is simply aware; he is not translating, neither condemning nor identifying, and so his responses are nonresidual, spontaneous.</p>
<p>There is a vast difference between residual response and awareness: the one is ever becoming, and so constant strife and pain, and the other is being aware of what is, and so understanding it goes above and beyond what is. The man of introspection can never transcend the object of his examination. If you go deeply into awareness, you will perceive the creative quality of being aware and the destructive quality of introspection. A man of introspection is concerned with changing what is and so can never be creative; he is concerned with his self-improvement and so can never be free. He is only moving within the walls of his own desires and so can never find reality. Reality will shun him, for he is caught in the net of becoming, becoming righteous. A respectable man, a righteous man, is a curse, which does not mean that the sinner is not also a curse. There is a possibility in the sinner to see, feel more, but the man enclosed in his own respectability can never perceive beyond his own walls. A man of awareness understands directly what is, and in its understanding there is instant transformation. This understanding is creation.</p>
<p>Questioner: Do you believe in immortality?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: What do you mean by belief, why do you believe, and what is there to believe? Do you believe that you are alive, that you see? Does not belief come into being when you are confused and anxious, and so give you a sense of well-being, of security? Belief, then, is other than what is and a man who is aware of what is has no need for belief, never believes. Belief is based on authority, inner or outer, as it gives him security, physical or psychological. A man who is secure, inwardly or outwardly, can never find the real. Only the man who is inquiring, uncertain, searching, neither accepting nor denying, can find truth. A man who is at ease, secure in his belief, is lost in credulity, in obstinacy; he is not only a prisoner to his belief, which destroys creative thinking, but also he is ever fearful and unhappy.</p>
<p>What do we mean by immortality? We will perhaps gather its significance if we understand what is continuity. If we can understand death, then perhaps we shall be able to perceive the meaning of immortality. If we can understand ending, then the immortal, the imperishable is. Death is the unknown; as reality, the imperishable, is the unknown, so is death. You have given your thought from time immemorial to the understanding of God; volumes have been written upon it, and yet you have avoided death. Why is it? Death, the unknown, you have shunned and put away, and God you have pursued; every temple has an image or an inscription, and you have given life to things made by the hand or by the mind. Why have you pursued God, the unknown? Do you know Him? If you did, it would be a different world, there would be love and goodness. Why do you accept the one, God, and shun the other, death? The one you shun, for you fear the ending of continuity; and you pursue the other for you crave continuity, permanency. You invest in God for the sake of permanency, not knowing what you are investing in. Is this not very odd? And after investing, you ask if there is immortality, for you desire a further guarantee; and you are gratified with him who gives you this assurance.</p>
<p>Surely, the problem is not if there is or if there is not immortality. If I tell you there is, will that assertion transform your life now?</p>
<p>No. If I tell you that there is no immortality, you will go to another until you find comforting assurance. You are caught between the believer and the nonbeliever, which causes pain. To understand the anxious fear of death, you must find out why there is an unbridgeable division between life and death, and why you pursue ceaselessly, generation after generation, what you call God, not knowing Him. Has there been a sacred book dealing with death? Yet there have been and will be book after book on what is called God. What reality is, is one thing, but if you know it as an idea, as a speculation, then it is another, then it is not the real. The unknown cannot be measured by words. The word is not the thing; the real cannot be told to him who is not aware of it. There is immediate communion between those who love. You may write poems concerning love, but you cannot communicate with another if he does not know love.</p>
<p>It is futile to inquire if there is God, but you will discover if there is or if there is not if you search it out. So you will find out the significance of death if you diligently and rightly search. You seek continuity through property, through name, family, and through belief and ideation. So long as you are assured of self-continuity, there is no fear. The man who is seeking psychological continuity invests in property, and finding its impermanency, he seeks it in other forms - in race, in nation, in organization, in activity, in love - and if that is denied, he seeks it in a temple, in church, and ultimately in what he calls God, and that is threatened also by death, the unknown. So you are not really concerned with reality, with God, with death, but with continuity, calling it by a lovely word, immortality. You desire only continuity in some form or another. What happens to anything that continues? It decays, it rots; it is caught in mere function, in routine, in habit. Continuance is an assurance of decay. When there is no fear, which comes only with the understanding of continuity, then only does the division between life and death cease.</p>
<p>Reality and death are the unknown, and a mind that has its being in the known can never understand the unknown. The known is ever the continuous. The mind clings to the known and gives life to the known, to memory; it is ever active in the house of the known and in that it craves to continue. That which is known is already in the net of time. Only when the mind frees itself from the net of time, is the eternal, the timeless. He who desires continuity is in constant fear of life and death, and the escapes that civilization has bred to pacify his fears have drugged him, made him dull; he is incapable of seeing the immense significance of death. Death is as rich as life, as the real; both are the unknown, and a mind that is caught in the known can never understand the imperishable, the immortal.</p>
<p>Questioner: Please explain further what you mean by the clarification of the conscious.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: Last Sunday I said that the superficial layers of consciousness must clarify themselves, free themselves from their entangling problems so that the hidden motives and pursuits, hopes and fears, can be perceived and understood. To understand the immediate, mind must be calm. If you have a problem, you worry over it as a dog worries over a bone - thinking about it, anxious to find a solution, you go to bed with it, worn out by the struggle. When you sleep your conscious mind is relaxed, quiet, and when you wake up the solution to the problem is often perceived. The conscious mind, having thought over the problem, has become calm, has detached itself from it, and so the deeper depths of consciousness can give the significance of the problem. The conscious mind, the upper layers of consciousness, must free themselves from problems, so that they are always tranquil, so that they can receive the hints, the intimations of the hidden. The conscious layers are restless, creating problem after problem, moving from one response to another, from one desire to another, from one distraction to another. Have you not noticed that the superficial layers of the mind are never still, their noisy activity overpowering all other action? They are ever battling and striving, cunning and alert in affairs and in the temple. How can such a mind receive anything? A drawer is useful only when it is empty. The conscious mind that is not empty is a useless mind, it is no good for anything save for modern civilization, which is so degenerate and dark, as this civilization is the product of the upper layers of consciousness. The upper layers of consciousness are mechanical, swift, and cunning, ever safeguarding themselves.</p>
<p>How does one bring about tranquillity in the superficial layers of consciousness? This is an inevitable response, but is it not a wrong question? Is this not a question put by the conscious mind, and so is it not still an activity of the immediate mind? The very action to clarify itself is still an activity of the conscious mind, is it not? And so the conscious mind is still active, only in another direction. What is important, then, is to be aware of what is, of the actual restless activity of this superficial mind; to be aware of it without denying it or justifying it; to be aware of its cunning substitutions, its distractions, its cunning. By being, not becoming aware of the superficial layers of consciousness, there comes tranquillity. The very awareness brings about understanding so long as there is no condemnation or justification. The mind, being aware of its own activities, brings about calmness. Be aware, simply aware, of a habit, and there will be the understanding and the ending of the habit. The mind is extremely active, and that which is fast cannot be understood unless it is slowed down; for the mind to slow itself down is very arduous. It can be done if every thought and feeling is thought out, felt out completely. To think out, feel out fully, there must not be any identification or condemnation.</p>
<p>Questioner: You have realized reality. Can you tell us what God is?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: How do you know, if I may ask, that I have realized? If you are aware that I have realized, then you also must have realized. To know is to be a partaker in knowledge. You also must experience to have an understanding of the experience. Besides, what does it matter if I have or have not realized? Is not what I am saying the truth? Even if I have not realized, as you call it, am I not speaking the truth? A man who worships another, even though he has realized, is worshipping for his gain, and so he will not find reality; he who worships those who have realized is giving himself over to authority, which is ever blinding, and so he will never find reality. It is not at all important, for the purposes of understanding, who has and who has not realized, though tradition says to the contrary. All that you can do is to keep company with good men, which is difficult, for the good are rare. The good are those who are not after some personal gain, who are not seeking advantage, who neither possess nor are possessed. You idealize him who has realized in the hope of gain, which creates a false relationship, and communion is only possible where there is love. In all these talks and discussions, we do not love each other; you are on the defensive and so afraid, you want something from me - knowledge, an experience, and so on - which indicates that there is no love. The desire to gain breeds authority, which is not only blinding but becomes the means of exploitation. Where there is love there is understanding; where there is love it is of little significance who has or who has not realized.</p>
<p>Since your heart has withered, God, the idea, has become all-important. You want to know God as you have lost the song in your heart, and you pursue the singer. Can the singer give you the song of your heart? He may teach you how to sing but he cannot give you the song. You may know the steps of a dance, but if there is no dance in your heart, you move mechanically. You do not know love if you are pursuing a gain, if you are searching out a result, an achievement. A man who loves has no ideal, but the man who has an ideal or the desire to achieve an ideal has no love. Beauty is not an ideal, an achievement; it is the reality of the now, not of tomorrow. Love understands the unknown; then the supreme is. But concerning it there is no word, for no word can measure it.</p>
<p>Love is its own eternity. Without love, there is no happiness; if there were love, you would not seek happiness in things, in family, in ideals, and then these things would have their right value. Because we do not love, you seek happiness in God. It is an investment in God, in the hope of happy returns. You want me to tell you what reality is. Can the immeasurable be measured by words? Can you catch the wind in your fist? If you formulate that which is the real, is that the real? When the unknown is translated into the known, it ceases to be the eternal. Yet you hunger after it. You crave to know for the continuance of yourself. You do not allow yourself to be aware of what is - the turmoil, the strife, the pain, the degradation - but long to escape from what is. Why do you not give your whole attention to what is, be aware of it, without condemnation or identification? In understanding the knowable, there comes tranquillity, not induced or enforced, but that silence which is creative emptiness in which alone reality can come into being. The becoming is incapable of receiving the real. In understanding what is, there is being. Then reality is not in the distance, the unknown is not far off, it is in what is. As the answer is in the problem, the reality is in what is. In the awareness of what is, there is truth, and it is truth that liberates, and not your striving to be free. Reality is not far, but we give it distance as a means of self-continuity. The timeless is the now, and it cannot be understood by him who is caught in the net of time. Meditation is for thought to free itself from time. Complete action, and not continuous action, is meditation. When the mind understands the process of continuity, memory - memory which is not only the factual but the psychological - there comes into being creative freedom. In continuity there is death, and in ending there is renewal.</p>
