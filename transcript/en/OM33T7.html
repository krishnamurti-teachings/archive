<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>The other day you were speaking of immortality. You said it was neither annihilation nor continuation. You said you would speak further on the subject. Will you please explain further?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are conscious only, at least for the major part of our day, of duality. There is in us a constant conflict of duality: the thing that is going to achieve and the achieved, the actor and the action. So in our mind there is continually the sense of duality, the ‘I’ and the ‘non-I’. Now, it is only when the mind and the heart are free of this duality, in that completeness, when the mind and heart are free of all sense of duality, in that completeness there is immortality.</p>
<p>Now we look to immortality as a continuance of the ‘I’. When we talk about immortality we want the particular, the ‘I’, to be continued through time, indefinitely, enduringly. We are only conscious, mostly, of the ‘I’. We have memory of that ‘I’ only and nothing else. We occasionally have a glimpse of that permanent thing, of the reality, but most often we are conscious of that ‘I’, the ‘I’ of Krishnamurti, of ?, Y, Z. So, being conscious of that ‘I’ all the time, we want that ‘I’ to continue; otherwise we think there is annihilation.</p>
<p>Now to me, the ‘I’ is but the result of conflict, is but the result of resistance, and we want to prolong it, this ‘I’, this conflict. We want to perfect this ‘I’; whereas if we are free of this conflict altogether, then there is, in that, immortality. In that, it is no longer a question of time, it is no longer ‘I’ enduring through time continually, without death. When the mind is free of the ‘I’, which can only happen in action, then in that there is realization of immortality, the timeless existence.</p>
<p>You know, it cannot be pictured, you cannot conceive mentally what immortality is. You cannot philosophize over it. It must be felt and it must be understood. Let me put it another way. There is immortality, but to realize it, one must start with the transient. Immortality lies in the transient, not away from the transient. Now we are discarding the transient and trying to find the permanent, whereas I say: Look to the transient and you will find the permanent, because when you discover what the transient values of your action are, born of mind and heart, in that transiency there is the fullness of that which is lasting, is eternal. Inherently in the transient itself is the permanent. We look to immortality as a means of escape or as an end to be arrived at through successive series of experiences. To me, immortality is to be free of all sense of conflict, and you can only be free of the sense of conflict when you have understood right values, and to understand right values, you must know all the transiency about you.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>We evade painful or unpleasant experiences. How can we be interested in all experiences?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why does one evade experience? Because one is afraid that one shall not gather the full meaning of that experience. Because one cannot gather the full significance of that experience, one suffers. Therefore one avoids it, and hence you choose experiences which are pleasant and experiences which are unpleasant, out of fear. Therefore, the experiences that you choose do not yield their full significance. You can only meet experiences without fear when you are not looking to gather the result from that experience.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Is there a natural control of one’s thoughts and emotions, which is not discipline?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I went into this pretty thoroughly last week, about discipline and the futility of discipline, so I will go briefly over it, and I hope you will understand. Is not self-discipline born of memory? That is, when one does not understand an experience fully, it leaves a mark, and we call that memory, and that memory is all the time trying to mold us in our action. That is, memory acts as a standard, to which your mind and heart are trying to be consistent all the time, hence the necessity for self-discipline. Whereas, if you are able to meet every experience with a free mind, with a freshness, then you will understand that experience, and the scratch of memory will not continue to act as a standard.</p>
<p>You see, we discipline ourselves because in our action there is division. There is the observer and the actor, the mind that looks and the thing that acts: therefore, the mind is acting all the time as a guide.</p>
<p>Most of our thoughts, our mind, is composed of “must,” and “must not.” It does not act completely. Mind is a guard which watches over and controls, dominates, and therefore when you act, such action is very limited. Whereas, if you act with harmony of mind as well as heart, that is with your whole being, then there is not the controller apart from action, and hence the futility of self-discipline.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>People who have had a glimpse of truth say that in such moments their ‘I’ consciousness has disappeared. Why is it not possible for such people to remain in that state permanently? What is the cause of their return to ‘I’ consciousness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The first part of this question, if I may say so, is wrongly put. The questioner says, “People who have had a glimpse of truth say that in such moments their ‘I’ consciousness has disappeared.” It is only when you are free from that sense of self-consciousness that you will know the permanent, the eternal. You see, here the questioner implies a coming back from a reality which he has perceived to be self-consciousness. So there is a sense of impermanence and a sense of the permanent. Most of us cling all the time, if we have caught a glimpse of reality, to the permanent; and so we try to make the permanent, through memory, lasting. I say, forget the permanent; don’t even think about it, but be only aware of the impermanent.</p>
<p>You know, if you have a pain, you take some kind of medicine and for the moment you forget that pain, and that pain returns again. Likewise, we have an occasional glimpse of the permanent, but more often we are conscious of the impermanent, of the transient, of the conflict, and the mind naturally clings - in the hope to make the permanent lasting - to that glimpse.</p>
<p>If the mind clings to the permanent, it cannot but be a drug, because it is trying to escape from the impermanent, from the conflict, from the transient. So that which it clings to cannot be true, because then that permanent is but an escape; therefore, it is not true. Whereas, if you understand the cause of conflict, if you understand the significance of your action, then in that there is permanency, and in that there is not this coming back and forth from the real to the false. So do not look to the permanent, but rather understand the transient, understand the cause of conflict which prevents you from understanding the permanent.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Is there anything which prevents one from being that truth of which you speak, if one attends a ceremony and enjoys that ceremony for its beauty - as another might enjoy a fine picture, or jewels, or anything - and when one takes part in the ceremony for its own sake, and not in order to gain power or degrees or anything of that sort?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We go through this regularly. If you enjoy ceremonies, enjoy! Why do you want a reason for it? You never asked this question with regard to music. You never say, “Should I enjoy music?” Or, “Should I enjoy a picture?” So why do you say, “Should I not enjoy ceremonies?”</p>
<p>My point of view with regard to ceremonies is very simple. I think where there is unrighteousness, there are ceremonies. Sorry, I am not being dogmatic or harsh. To me, ceremonies have no meaning, no significance. They are created by men through fear. We give all kinds of significance to them - that they help, that they are beautiful, that power pours through them - all those things. One goes to those ceremonies in order to get sensationally elevated, sensationally gratified, and we all hope we are getting nearer and nearer truth through those ceremonies, somehow or other - that it will help man to coordinate his body, his ideas, etc. To me, ceremonies act as a drug: they help for a moment to make you forget. So do not compare ceremonies with music, with painting, with beautiful pieces of art. The music, art, is born not out of fear; it is a natural, spontaneous expression; whereas ceremonies are created through fear in search for divinity and righteous behavior, to urge people in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Please, that is my opinion, and I know that lots of people are feeling uncomfortable. To find out if you are a slave to ceremony - because, after all, one is a slave to a thing when one has not found out its true value - to find out if you are really free to act as a complete human being, discover for yourself the true value of ceremonies. To discover, do not say, “It is right,” or “It is wrong.” Be completely detached from it, and then you will find out whether it has value. But both the ceremonialist and the nonceremonialist are attached, and therefore their discernment is not true. To understand a thing, let it go and then examine it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Does an action necessarily need to express itself in the physical world be complete? For example, if a man hates another one to the point of wanting to hurt him, shall his action be complete only if he hurts or kills him, or can he free himself and learn in the same way by facing this violent feeling inwardly?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why do you want to hurt another? Either because you want something from him, and he does not give it to you, and therefore you are annoyed and want to hurt him in return, or he has deprived you of something, or you are jealous. He has taken away something from you or he has not given you what you want. You are awakened to your own insufficiency, to your own littleness, emptiness, and to run away, to escape from that, you get annoyed, you want to hurt. In hurting, would you consider that a complete action, born out of fear, born out of that loneliness?</p>
<p>To me, it is not a complete action. Is it not simple? I know discussions have been taking place here whether you should go out and kill people, because you have heard me talking about acting completely. What a waste of time! Either you do not understand the significance of my words, or you understand merely the superficial meanings. So wait a minute. You want to hurt another when you are conscious of your own loneliness, when you are forced to face your own emptiness, and you react against the person who forces you to that conscious emptiness, and if you react from that, it is but a reaction. Whereas, if you find out what is the cause of that loneliness and free yourself from that cause and then act, in that there is harmony, in that there is completeness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>The liberation you explain to us, which you have reached yourself, is that all? Or is it the key to the door which leads to still higher conditions of universal life?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If you have a pain and someone relieves you of that pain, you don’t say, “Is that all?” If you are happy, you don’t say, “Is that all?” Why do you put such a question? Because you do not really understand what liberation means! To me, it is an eternal becoming, but you can only know it when the mind is free of this continual, ceaseless effort, which is also a transient becoming. That which is growing is not eternal, and we are conscious of this ceaseless growing, expanding of mind and heart and all that, achievement. You say, “If I do not achieve, if I do not grow, what is there?” You will know what is there when your mind and heart have understood the true value, the true worth of this ceaseless growing; therefore, understand that, not what is beyond liberation or whether liberation is a door which opens to greater life. But begin with that thing which is gnawing your mind and heart, that ceaseless growing, wanting to grow.</p>
<p>Liberation to me is an infinite becoming, but one has to understand it, this timeless becoming. Time will exist so long as there is effort: effort in the pursuit of virtue, effort in developing character, effort in regard to the possession of a will, effort with regard to choice. All these indicate a limitation of time and this ceaseless effort of growing with which we identify ourselves as self-consciousness, as the ‘I’.</p>
<p>When the mind is free of that, then you will know what liberation is. You cannot picture, you cannot imagine what this timeless becoming is. If you could imagine it, it must of necessity be born of opposites; therefore, it cannot be true. Therefore, do not begin with that; do not try to picture to yourself what this thing is. Please, do try it, and you will see how simple it is. Begin with something of which you are conscious, of which you know, this conflict, this suffering, this continual battle of choice - and they will exist as long as the mind and heart are craving for achievement, for success, gain, result. And there is that search for a result, gain, achievement, because one is empty. One wants to cover it up, fill it up; we want all the time to accumulate and the very accumulation creates emptiness. The very pursuit of achievement brings emptiness. If you really see this, if you really feel it, then you will not run away, then you will stop up all the avenues of escape, and then you will face that loneliness, and out of that comes pure action.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Should an experience he remembered until it is understood or not remembered at all?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You cannot forget an experience which you have not understood. It remains. But if you have understood a thing, it is over; the mind is free to face life afresh, anew. It is experiences which have not been completely understood, that create a barrier, that give the mind a jaded memory, which prevents you from living each day afresh, anew.</p>
<p>So it is not a question of remembering or not remembering a particular experience, but it is meeting all experiences afresh - with open frankness - and you can only meet an experience frankly, openly, freshly, when your mind is not seeking a result or when the mind is not shaped, molded, through consistency born of memory, through limitation. Our minds are caught up in all these things and therefore we cannot meet these experiences frankly. That is why I say: Be fully aware how your mind is acting and how your heart is feeling, whether it is born of the search for a reward, or born of escape from fear. And then, when you are free from all these things, because you understand them - not because you have thrown them away - then you can meet them; then you can have a mind and heart that are swift to follow wisdom, and in that there is ecstasy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>Please explain the difference between awareness and watching.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In watchfulness there is always the desire to gain; in awareness there is direct perception.</p>
<p>When do you watch? First of all, why is there a watcher? Who is the watcher? You call it a higher self, who watches the lower. That is, you have established a duality, a division, a distinction in your action, because you do not approach that action fully, completely, with both your mind and heart. Therefore there is a distinction, as an observer, a watcher, who looks upon his act. So that watcher is continually guiding, shaping; he is never taking part in the act; he is always aloof, objective. That is not awareness, because that watchfulness creates duality; there is always a distinction. Whereas, awareness is complete action in which the mind and heart are one.</p>
<p>When you do anything naturally, with great interest, simply, spontaneously, there is no observer; there is not a thing which watches that act, such as when you love. But there is an observer when your action is born of fear, or when you have incompletely understood an experience, the “I must” and “I must not,” the mind which is always warning. So I hope you will see the difference between awareness and watchfulness. The two have nothing to do with each other. When you have a natural, spontaneous interest you do that thing harmoniously, wholly, without this division of the watcher, the mind which is looking to analyze it. It is only when your mind and heart are not fully interested that there is born the watcher, the difficulty, the control, the discipline imposed by the watcher. You may call it the higher self, but it is still a duality.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>One begins to untie one knot and finds that there are a dozen others. Where shall one begin and where end?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If you untie the knot of one difficulty because you have found a solution for that knot, then there will be a dozen other knots. If I untie, unravel, a difficulty, a problem, in the search of a solution, then I develop other knots. Most people are seeking a way out of a difficulty; they are seeking a solution. They are not concerned in untying, but they are concerned with a solution, a way out of that difficulty.</p>
<p>If I have a difficulty, I do not want to seek a solution for the difficulty. I know there are solutions, innumerable solutions, but I want to find out what the cause of that problem is, and when I have really understood the cause of that problem, I do not create any other knots, any other problems. If I really understand one problem completely, wholly, then there are no other problems. Please, think it over and you will see.</p>
<p>It is because we do not face one thing completely, we create many others. We go from one thing to another. Life becomes one series of problems, because we have not been able to understand or to tackle one thing only. Therefore, it depends on how you untie the knot - not what solution you apply to it but the manner, with what awareness you do it. You can untie a knot observing it, analyzing it, carefully, mentally, and therefore creating another set of problems, or you can in awareness, in meeting that problem wholly, with your mind and heart, with your whole being, approach that problem and then it dissolves. Therefore, everything you meet you are able to meet wholly, and are therefore free, and therefore the thing that you meet does not leave a scar, which you call a problem.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Question: </span>You spoke of a child who was told of reincarnation when asking about death. The child was weeping at the death of a playmate. What would you have done or what would you have said to it to help it understand?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What I am going to say sounds so absurdly simple that I hope you will understand it. I personally would tell that child: Look at a flower, it withers and dies. I can say it because I am not afraid of death; it is a natural thing, inevitable. All things must wear out and die. Because one is afraid of death, one is not able to face it simply. I am not talking of accepting the inevitable. We all do that. That is a foolish way of looking at life. So, if you are not afraid, you do not give complicated reasons, such as reincarnation. What can the child understand about reincarnation? You think it understands it because you yourself feel satisfied with that idea. If mommy is satisfied, then I must be satisfied with it. You pass that atmosphere of satisfaction, and the child, being very sensitive, takes it on.</p>
<p>So, what causes you to be afraid of death? Because first you say, “I do not know what life is beyond.” And you say that because this life has not been full. You are concerned with what lies beyond the grave and hereafter, only when this life has not given you its richness, its plenitude. If this life is rich, if your single day is immense, complete, then you are not afraid of tomorrow, but you look to tomorrow when today has crumbled.</p>
<p>In reincarnation there is ever death, there is ever a beginning and a death. That idea does not really free you from fear; you momentarily postpone, that is all. You may be united with your friend, your lover, your brother, or anyone, but there is still death. You are satisfied with that idea because it momentarily gives you satisfaction. So, as it gives you satisfaction, you pass it on to your child, to your neighbor, to anybody else, because they are all wanting satisfaction. And so they all take up your idea, and so you have created a wonderful society, organization, in which all believe in reincarnation, and you think you have solved the problem.</p>
<p>I am not sarcastic, but I am just showing you that where there is that idea of reincarnation, there must also be a death at the same time; therefore, you have not really understood, you have but escaped. What creates fear of death is incompleteness, and incompleteness is not overcome by an idea, or by following a pattern or living to a certain set of standards. When the mind is free of all these standards, there is understanding of right values. Then there is a complete act, and in that act, in living completely - which is action in infinity - in that there is no beginning or end, and then you are not afraid of death.</p>
<p>You see, you cannot explain all this to a child. If it were a very small child, I would talk to it about the flower and show it to him or her, and as it grows up discuss it, awaken its own intelligence, not push down your ideas on it. You see, one must have an exquisitely pliable mind to understand truth, a very subtle mind. For wisdom is very swift, and to follow it you must be unhampered, and all incompleteness which creates memory is hampering, is a limitation, and such a mind cannot understand.</p>
<p>So, you will know that deathless becoming without an end or a beginning when you are living completely. Do not say, “Is that all, or will it lead me further?” If you are not completely living, then you will ask “Is that all, or will it lead me further?” Then your day is not rich or simple, then your act is not complete, because you are always looking to further things. Your action is merely then a means to an end. Such an action can only be incomplete. Whereas, if you live completely in action, then you will not be afraid of death, then reincarnation becomes a very small thing.</p>
<p>You know, if you are living without that sense of ‘I’, which is the discovery of right values, then you are no longer limited by time. Now we are limited by time. There is yesterday, today, and tomorrow, not a thing which is complete, which has no beginning and no end. That timeless becoming - or that becoming in which there is no time, in which there is not the division of the past, present, and future - you can only understand when your mind is free from all choice, because choice creates opposites. And in true discernment, which is not born of opposites, there is a timeless living reality.</p>
