<p>This evening I will answer questions only. If you can listen with right awareness, without prejudice, we shall understand more deeply and extensively. So, if I may suggest, it would be good if you listen without the effort made to listen; and though you may have defenses of prejudice, it would be well if you would understand. Put the armor of prejudice aside, and let us think together of the various problems we shall deal with this evening.</p>
<p>Questioner: Are ideals the only thing between ourselves and madness? You are breaking a dam which keeps chaos out of our homes and fields. Why are you so foolhardy? The immature or unsteady minds will be thrown off their feet by your sweeping generalizations.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: This question is put with regard to what I have said concerning ideals, examples, and the opposites. So, I will have to restate what I have said about ideals.</p>
<p>I have said that ideals in any form are an escape from the understanding of what is. Ideals, however noble and however fine, have no reality: they are fictitious. It is more important to understand what is than to pursue or to follow an ideal or an example or a pattern of action. You have innumerable ideals - peace, nonviolence, nongreed, etc. - within which your minds are enclosed; they are not really factual, they are nonexistent. Since they are nonexistent, of what value are they? Do they help you to understand your conflict, your violence, your greed? Are they not a hindrance to such understanding? Will this screen of ideals help you to understand arrogance and corruption? Can a violent man be nonviolent through the ideal of nonviolence? Must you not put aside the screen of ideals and examine violence? Will the ideal help to bring about understanding? Is evil understood through the ideal of good? Or is evil transformed - not through the ideal, not through the pursuit of its opposite - but in facing it without resistance and understanding it. Does not the ideal in any form prevent the understanding of what is?</p>
<p>Surely, you have each one tried the pursuit of the opposites and are caught in the conflict bred by the opposite. You are familiar with the constant struggle of the opposites, of the thesis and of the antithesis, and hoping to arrive at a synthesis - capitalism in conflict with the left - hoping to arrive at a synthesis, that synthesis again creating its own opposite, and again producing a synthesis, and so on and on. We are familiar with this state.</p>
<p>Now, is this struggle necessary? Is not this struggle unreal? Is not the opposite itself unreal? What is the real, the actual? The opposite is fictitious, not real. The actual is greed. The ideal of nongreed is nonexistent; it is the creation of the mind giving it an opportunity to escape from what is.</p>
<p>If you have no ideals, will you collapse, will you fall apart? Are your ideals acting as a dam against evil and unkind action? Is your ideal of nonviolence preventing you from being nonviolent? Obviously, it is not. So, ideals are nonexistent except in theory, and therefore valueless. An idealist is really a man who is escaping, avoiding direct action with regard to what is. By removing the ideals, will the weak-minded be thrown off their feet? The weak-minded are thrown off their feet anyhow by the politicians, by the gurus, by the priests, by the innumerable ceremonies and exploitations, but the man who is strong anyhow disregards the ideals and pursues what he wants. So, neither the weak nor the strong pay any attention to ideals. The ideal is a convenient easy cover for false and thoughtless action. The ideal of the opposite is a hindrance to the direct understanding of what is. You can understand what is only when you are not escaping from it through the fantasy of an ideal. The ideal prevents you from looking at it, examining it, and dealing with it directly. As you do not want to deal with it directly, you invent the ideal and so what is can be postponed.</p>
<p>So, our problem is how to transcend, to go beyond that which is - not how to go beyond the opposites which the mind has created. Obviously, what is can be understood completely, wholly, when you are aware of the whole psychological significance of what is. You understand what is only when all escapes have ceased. To acknowledge what is, whether it is greed or it is a lie, requires an honesty of awareness. To be aware that one is greedy is already the beginning of freedom from greed. Seeing the truth in the false and truth as truth is the beginning of understanding. It is the perception of truth that liberates, and not the pursuit of the opposite or of the ideal.</p>
<p>Questioner: Will sexual urge disappear when we refuse to name it?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: This question needs considerable explanation. The process of naming or terming is quite a complex problem, and to understand it, we must go into the whole problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>What do we mean by consciousness? Consciousness is surely the state of experiencing, which is the response to challenge. The beginning of consciousness is challenge, response, and experiencing. The experience is named or termed or given a label, as pleasant or unpleasant, and it is recorded and put away in the mind. So, consciousness is a process of experiencing, naming, and recording. Without these three processes, which are really a unitary process, there is no consciousness. This process is going on all the time at different levels. This song is repeated in different moods, with different themes; but it is always, at whatever level, the same process of experiencing, naming, and recording. This is the theme, this is the record that is being played.</p>
<p>Now, what would happen if we put an end to naming? Why do you give a name to an experience, calling it pleasant or unpleasant, meritorious or unworthy, good or bad, and so on? We give it a name either to communicate or to fix it in memory, which gives it a continuity. To have no continuity, the mind is not, condemnation is not. You must give continuity to an experience; otherwise, self-consciousness ceases. Therefore, you give a name to an experience. The giving of a name to a feeling, to an experience, is instantaneous. The mind which is the record keeper, which is memory, labels a feeling in order to give itself stability and continuity. But, supposing you did not term the feeling - which is quite arduous because the naming of the feeling is instantaneous - what would happen to a feeling? If you did not, the record keeper, the mind, could not grapple with the feeling. He cannot give it substance, strength; so the feeling withers away.</p>
<p>You can experiment with it in your daily life and discover for yourself what happens to a feeling when you do not term it. You will discover an odd thing happening; you will find that the feeling withers away. The naming of a feeling, of an experience, gives permanency to the thinker, the record keeper. We know what happens when we give a name to a feeling, to an experience: we give a continuity to that experience, upon which the mind feeds and so becomes vital. When you give a name to a feeling, you put it within the framework of reference, so the very nature of terming an experience is to give continuity to consciousness, to the 'me' and 'mine'. We are so swiftly and unconsciously doing it all the time. This record is being played at different levels with different themes, with different words, all the time, whether waking or sleeping. By not terming a feeling, the feeling withers away.</p>
<p>Now, you have learned a trick. You will say to yourself, ''I know how to deal with unpleasant feelings, how to put an end to them quickly: I will not name them.'' But will you do the same with the so-called pleasant feelings? You want to continue the so-called pleasant feelings, pleasant emotions, that give you substance, and these you want to maintain. So, you will begin to choose those that are pleasant and term them; and those which you call unpleasant, let them wither away by not naming them. By this process you are inevitably sustaining the conflict of the opposites; whereas, if you do not term a sensation, a feeling, whether pleasant or unpleasant, it comes to an end. So, the thinker, the record keeper, the creator of the opposites, withers away.</p>
<p>But is love a sensation, an emotion which can be termed and so given a continuity? Or, by not naming it, will it wither away? When you love some person and when you think of him, what happens? You are only dealing with the sensations caused by that person. You are concerned with emotions, sensations of that person; the more you give emphasis to them, the less there is of love.</p>
<p>Now, the questioner asks whether the sexual urge will disappear when it is not termed. It will disappear, obviously. But, if you do not understand the whole process of consciousness, which has been explained carefully, the mere putting an end to an urge, whether pleasant or unpleasant, does not bring about the eternal quality of love. Without love, merely to put an end to an urge has no meaning. You will become dry as an idealist. Where there is love, there is chastity. The man who is passionate, who craves after the ideal of chastity, will never know love. He is caught in the conflict of opposites; and as the ideal is nonexistent, he lives in illusion. Such a man is empty of heart, and he fills it with the things made by the mind, which are ideals. Once you open the door to the understanding of your whole being, you will discover great riches. But to discover, there must be freedom to experiment. Freedom comes through virtue - not becoming virtuous, but being virtuous.</p>
<p>Questioner: Why can't you influence the leaders of a party, or members of a government, and work through them?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: For the simple reason that leaders are the factors of degeneration in society and governments are the expression of violence. How can anyone who attempts to understand the truth work through instruments opposed to reality?</p>
<p>Why do we want leaders - political or religious? Because we want to be directed, we must be told what to think and what to do. Our education and our social system are based on compulsion and imitation. When there is confusion, you look to another to lead you out of it. Can any leader, political or religious, liberate you from your own misery? For in leadership is implied power, position, prestige. The leader becomes the exploiter of the follower, and the follower exploits the leader. The leader feels lost, frustrated without a follower, and the follower feels confused and uncertain without direction. So, it is a mutual process of exploitation when there is a desire for power, position, and a craving for guidance. When the leader becomes the authority to whom everything is referred, politically or religiously, then you are merely the record player, and so you become thoughtless and uncreative.</p>
<p>So, what is important is to understand your own sorrow and confusion and your disastrous existence. To understand it, need you have a leader? Surely not. What you need is attention to look closely and clearly with eyes that are not biased. You have to be aware of your own thoughts and feelings, which is self-knowledge and which no leader can give you. The leader becomes important only when he helps you to run away from yourself. Then the leader can be worshipped, put in a cage, and whispered about. Thus, the leader becomes a degenerating factor in society. A society that is creative has no leader because every individual in it is a light unto himself.</p>
<p>Questioner: By what mechanism do we change the world when we change ourselves?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: The individual problem is the world's problem. The individual, with his inner conflicts, with his psychological struggles and frustrations, with his anxieties a hopes, creates the world of relationship about him. What he is, the world is. The individual and the world are not separate processes - they are inseparable - they are one process. The world is you, and the world is not apart from you. This is not a mystical statement but an actuality. What you are, that you project outwardly, which becomes the world. However cunningly and diligently the outer is systematized, regulated, and constructed, the inner will inevitably overcome the outer. So, there must be the transformation of the inner, not in opposition to the outer, not in antagonism to the many, to the collective.</p>
<p>As you are a total process, you must begin with yourself. By transforming yourself, you will inevitably affect the complex state of relationship, that is, the world in which you live. You cannot transform the world: the world has no referent. The individual has a referent, which is you, so you must begin with yourself - not for individualistic perfection, which leads to isolation, to segregation. Nothing can exist in isolation. This isolation, which takes the form of self-improvement, is destructive to understanding, for it is a process of self-enclosure.</p>
<p>So, by transforming yourself you bring about a revolution in the immediate world of your relationship. So, the mechanism of transformation is brought about swiftly by your action of understanding. As long as you are acquisitive, envious, and nationalistic, you will inevitably create the structure of a society in which these things are encouraged and maintained. These are ultimately the causes of war. As long as you are seeking power, position of authority, you will inevitably bring about conflict between man and man. The way of peace is your responsibility, as you are responsible for the way of war. As belief and ideology, organized religion and nationalism separate man from man, creating antagonism between man and man, you who are the creator of this antagonism, and so of destruction, must transform yourself. So, regeneration must begin with yourself, yourself who is a total process of man. This regeneration is not opposed to another individual or to the collective world. The other and the collective is a total process as yourself, and to have antagonism for another is to be antagonistic to yourself. So, you have to be aware of every thought, every feeling, and every action.</p>
<p>So, in understanding yourself completely, you will find love. It is only love that transforms. Without love, there can be no peace and happiness in you and so in the world.</p>
<p>Questioner: What is true and what is false in the theory of reincarnation?</p>
<p>Krishnamurti: It is important in understanding this question that we should have an inquiring mind and an open mind. Inquiry implies the search for truth. Truth is not according to any system at all; it is not in the net of belief or dogma. This inquiry is impeded when there is prejudice and dishonesty of thought. Mere quotation of an authority, however ancient or learned, will not yield the freedom of truth. Inquiry must be free from prejudice and belief; if you are tethered to them, you can wander only within the radius of your own bondage, but within it truth can never be.</p>
<p>What is the thing that reincarnates? What is the continuous quality that comes into rebirth? There are only two states that have a possibility of continuing: one, the spiritual entity called the soul, or the other, the 'me' and the 'mine'. The spiritual entity must be something that is not created by the 'me' and the 'mine'. It cannot be the outcome of a thought process. It must be, if it is the spiritual entity, something beyond ignorance and illusion. If it is something other than 'me', it must be timeless, and that which is timeless cannot evolve, grow, become it is deathless. If it is deathless, it is beyond 'me', beyond my consideration and not within the field of my consciousness. So, you cannot think about it; you cannot inquire if it can or cannot reincarnate. Since it is timeless and deathless, and as you are concerned about death and time, you cannot inquire into it. To speculate upon the nature of the spiritual entity is an escape, and speculation about the unknown is an escape and a definite hindrance to the understanding of truth.</p>
<p>You are really not concerned about the continuance of the spiritual entity but with the continuance of yourself, the 'me' - the 'me' and the 'mine' with its achievements and failures, with its frustrations and bank accounts, with its characteristics and idiosyncrasies. You want to know if the 'me' of your property, the 'me' of your family, the 'me' of your beliefs, if the 'you', which is a physiological as well as a psychological process, has a continuance when the physical existence ceases.</p>
<p>What do you mean by continuity? We have examined more or less what we mean by 'me' and 'mine': the name, the characteristics, the achievements at all different levels of consciousness. What do you mean by continuity, and what is it that gives continuity? What is it that clings to continuity, continuity in the form of permanency? If you are assured of permanency, then you would not cling to continuity. You seek permanency or security in possessions and in things, in family or in belief. When the body dies, the permanency of things and the permanency of family are gone, but the permanency of idea may continue. It is the idea that we want to continue. The thought, the idea of 'me' - will it continue? This continuous becoming from experience to experience - will this formulation of 'me' continue? Thought identified as the 'me' continues, has substance. Like the electronic waves, thought has existence. This thought, when identified by you, is you; and so, thought as you continues.</p>
<p>Now, what happens to that which continues? What happens to that which is in constant becoming, moving from experience to experience? That which continues has no renewal. That which moves from experience to experience - which is becoming - is constantly reconditioning itself, and so it has no renewal. The 'me' identified with thought has continuance, but that which continues is in constant decay, for it is moving from experience to experience, accumulating, and so acting within the net of time. There is only renewal when there is constant experiencing without the accumulation of experience, which is, without yesterday. That which ends has a beginning, but that which is continuous can have no regeneration, nor transformation. Only in death is there renewal, the death to the moment, to the day. Only in ending is there love. Love is new from moment to moment. Love is not continuous; it is not repetition. That is the greatness and beauty of love.</p>
<p>Some of you will probably say that I have not answered about what is true and what is false in the theory of reincarnation. If you will ponder over what I have said, you will see that I have pointed out what is true and what is false. To the deep problems of life, there is no categorical yes and no. It is only the thoughtless that seek the yes and the no to a problem. In inquiring into this problem, we have found the truth of continuity. Life and death are one, and he who knows it dies every minute. Immortality is not the continuance of identified thought. The mortal cannot seek the immortal. Immortality comes into being when the thought process as the 'me' and the 'mine' ceases.</p>
