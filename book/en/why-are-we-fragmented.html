<h1>1. Where There Is Self-interest Love Is Not</h1>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> How are we going to start? Will you please ask?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I have a lot of questions, I have got notes of them here which I will consult if I may from time to time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I think you had better speak a little louder.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> All right. And I will just start with one that interests me and we will see where we go because there is a lot that I would like to ask.</p>
<p>It is about the word 'experience' which you sometimes use in your writings as representing something which you think we should in some sense overcome. And you seem to connect the idea of experience with the notion of preconceived attitudes or dogmas or beliefs, which impede a kind of being which you would connect with a creative present existence. I don't entirely understand this. It seems to me that it is impossible entirely to...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> ...wipe out experience...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> ...discount or escape from experience. But I would like just to stick to the term experience because it is such a very general world, perhaps there is a particular sense you want to attach to it, it seems to describe the continuity of consciousness which is simply characteristic of being human. Perhaps you could say something about that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I don't know quite what you mean by experience. One can experience what one desires.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You mean imagining it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes. And also one can experience according to your conditioning. If I am a Buddhist, and a devout Buddhist, I can experience the state of that consciousness which was supposed to have been Buddha's.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well this is a rather special sort of experience isn't it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes. So I am just questioning what we mean by experience. I can experience anger. Is there a difference between the experience and the experiencer?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well this is a difficult question about how one is going to use the concept because the word experience in English describes something fairly vague. It can mean either, I had a strange experience yesterday, or it can mean the continuity of your conscious life and your relationship to your past. Or it can mean something momentarily. But I think what you are wanting to mean by it is something which connects your past as it were, and at one point I think you describe desire as experience, whereas love is not experience.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Love cannot be experienced.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Could you just explain what the distinction is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Could we go into the question of who experiences the whole thing, anything, whether it is the experience of something imagined, or experience your past tradition and images, past figures and so on? You understand?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You say, who is the experiencer?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Who is experiencing?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well this is a difficult question too, isn't it? If one were to ask a passer-by in the street he would say the individual.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, I am experiencing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes these experiences belong to me.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I had an experience of an accident this morning in a car. I experience so many things.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But then, I mean, if one were to pursue the matter beyond that kind of answer, one might say well of course one must distinguish between different kinds of experience, and one would then, I think, I mean let's say I can think of say three kinds immediately: there is the experience of my past life, you say of somebody, "He is an experienced man" meaning he has lot of experiences of some kind perhaps, and then you would say that experience is just the continuity of my consciousness, going away into the past.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Or continuity of one's consciousness. What do you mean by the word 'consciousness'?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well then let's pursue the matter in this way, in that one would say consciousness differs at different times. And the word experience I would think would differ whether you were talking about just ordinary life. Let's put it this way: partly you were sort of imposing yourself on the world and you say "I am doing this", "I am doing that", and this would be perhaps experience. But also there could be an experience where you aren't really present.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That's it, that's just it. Where the experiencer is not is there an experience, which you can then remember and say "This is it"?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I would think that people have what I would call selfless experience when - well for instance when they are looking at a great work of art.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I am not sure about whether if they are with somebody they loved very much, whether one could say this, perhaps. I think these two cases are very different. But what do you think?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I would like to go into this question, if I may, who is experiencing all this? Whether it is the ordinary things, or the most complicated forms of experiences, or so-called spiritual experiences. Right? Who is it that is always experiencing? Is the experiencer different from the experience?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well we would normally say so wouldn't we because one may believe in the continuity of an individual person.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, that is what is commonly held. Now we are going to question that. That is, is the experiencer, or the thinker different from his thoughts?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well again we would usually say so because one could say. "I order my thoughts". This assumes that I am deciding, I collect my thoughts.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes. But is that I, who orders his thoughts, different from his thoughts? He may order them, he may discipline them, he may control them, he might say, "This is right", "This is wrong", "This must be done", "That must not be done", but is the controller, the person who disciplines, brings order, is he different from the things which he is ordering about?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well, let's make a distinction here between ordinary language where one speaks about, I mean in a Law Court, or something, somebody is responsible for something they have done. They can't say, "Well I am a different person now" or something. In the ordinary sense of the continuity of the individual and somebody being the subject. But leaving that aside, I mean one doesn't have to be philosopher or hold a religious view to think that one is divided, one is a divided person.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That's it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And there are times when one part of you disapproves of another part.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> This dualistic process, is there a difference between - we come back to the old question - the good and the bad?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well nothing could be more fundamental, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It comes to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I mean this seems to me the nature of the real world.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I know. The real world is we have divided the good and the bad, and the thinker, the experiencer from the experience.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, this would follow in that if you condemn yourself for doing something then you are divided.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I should not, I must, I will become, and all the rest of it, it breeds division in oneself. I would like to ask, if I may, is that experiencer, or the thinker different from the thing he is experiencing or the thinker different from his thoughts?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well if this is an appeal - the word experience comes up to my mind - if this is an appeal to how I think about myself, I would say, leaving aside the common sense, the ordinary language, sometimes yes, and sometimes no. I mean that sometimes one is consciously judging oneself, dividing oneself, sometimes there is nothing except a single something or other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> A single movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> A single being or something.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> So is not the experiencer the same as the experience?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well it sometimes seems so.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> So when we say. "I am envious", then there is a division.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Then I try to control my envy, or rationalize my envy, or justify, or suppress and so on, but the 'I' is envy not separate from it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I would have thought it is and it isn't. There are two things that you say in what I have read and what I understood from our last conversation, perhaps I can put it this way. There are two things which you seem to me to say which I don't understand how they connect or harmonize. I mean one of the things is I think, which I liked very much, you said that if I think that I am - if I condemn myself - well put it this way: if I think that I am envious, say, now the word 'envy' suggests something which is bad so one wants not to be envious perhaps. If I see this I must start, not in a kind of ideal selfish way that doesn't exist but in my real being which is the envious person. I feel great sympathy with this. But then you also say that there is no process, I must be good, not become good, the idea of becoming good is in some way an illusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Perhaps you could explain, I mean it seems to me that in the one case you are suggesting that I must start from a goal which is a long way from my conclusion, my conclusion would be to become non-envious. The other way you are saying that there is no process of becoming.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> For me there is no psychological becoming at all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, well this is what I don't understand because... go on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Go into it. First of all let's come to this point: we have divided the world, and in myself, the good and the bad - right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But you don't dispute this. You don't object to this?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I don't refute, I am just looking at it. Is the bad related to the good? Or is the good totally divorced from the bad? They are not related at all. If they are related the good is still part of the bad.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well if you are asking me would I agree with that, I am not sure. I mean I think we think about good and bad in several different ways, don't we? We think of bad weaving into good as if it were a spectrum, with goodness is here say and badness here.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, a continuity of the bad.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> A continuity of the bad. We also think, I think, of good, if we think of it as perfection, of being really outside the world altogether.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I don't know perfection - being good, whole, good health, good man, good - you know the word 'good'.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well let's say good man then.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Is that good part of the bad? Does the good know the bad? Or the good is the outcome of the bad? Then if it is the outcome then it is still part of the bad. It's like a child being born, it is still part of the mother.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, some people would say that they are opposites which exist in relation to each other, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, now I say, are they opposite? Or they are totally, they have no relation?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well, there is a very clear different between a bad man and a good man. So in that sense they are very different. On the other hand in a human being good and bad grade into each other, and sometimes you don't know which is which.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, that's what I am questioning. That is what I would like to discuss with you. I feel, I mean to me the good is totally divorced from the bad, like love is not related to hate.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, yes. I mean in ordinary fallen human conditions of course love often occasions hate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Whereas you say love is not related to hate, you mean that it is an entirely different kind of concept?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Love has no feeling about hate, it has no relation to hate, it is not encompassing or embracing hate.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Wait a minute. Let me ask a supplementary question. Would you say the same about love and desire? If we took those two words.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, I would.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You say yes. You regard desire as something connected with psychological becoming?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Love is...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> ...entirely something different.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well now, how does this different thing come to one? I might say now why should it concern me? What am I to do about it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It is simple enough. There is conflict. If there is conflict, desire always brings conflict, but love can never bring conflict. Love has no conflict, it has no sense of conflict.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, you are using the word 'love' in an ideal sense, which is unusual.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, I am using it, say for instance, I don't know if you want to go into it. The brain is the entire centre of desire, feeling, anxiety, pain, loneliness - you follow? The consciousness is all that. The belief, the fears, the sorrow, the loneliness, the anxiety, the whole - you know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> The sort of psychological.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes. The psychological structure, confusion. That's the brain. And therefore love is not part of the brain because it is something outside.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> So yes, but this comes back to your saying you don't experience love in the way in which you experience desire.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I can' experience something which is so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I mean if I am loving, I mean again let's put this aside that in ordinary parlance you speak of jealous love or something, that is not what we are talking about. One's talking about some sort of absolute or, I can't think of the right word here. But then if I say I dearly love somebody as one might say in not a bad way but in a good way, as it were, would you want to say this is not part of any psychological process?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No. I would say: I say I love you, if I love somebody in that way. If there is any tinge of attachment, any tinge of jealousy, any shadow of conflict, then it is not the real thing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, yes. All right. Yes. I mean I was brought up as a Christian so there is a lot of the Christian way of looking in me, although I don't believe in god or the divinity of Christ, but I can see in Christianity there would be an idea of divine love, or perfect love, which is something that we don't normally achieve at all perhaps.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I don't see why not. Because if I am not jealous, I won't be jealous. There is no sense of attachment to another person, which doesn't mean lack of love.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Attachment and desire - well I think what in ordinary parlance we would call a virtuous love, not hurting anybody else by loving this person, and you are not possessive, unreasonable and so on, there is attachment. I mean particularly if the person dies...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Wait a minute. Now that is a different question. Why are we attached to anything? Attached. If I am attached to this house...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I would take a different view I think of the notion of desire. I mean it seems to me I would think that becoming good, to use this phrase that perhaps you would want to exclude, is a matter of purifying one's desires, having good desires, desiring something which is good. Now in loving somebody I would have felt that the element of desire was present.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Let's look at desire. What is desire?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well, there again one would say well there are low desires and there are high desires.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, I am asking, what is the origin, the beginning of desire? Why has desire become such an extraordinary important part of our life?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well desire is certainly connected with the future.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> With the future.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> It is connected with time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Of course, with time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Because I desire something which is absent. I mean let's take examples. I might desire to be frightfully rich, or I might desire to study a subject and become good at it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Good at the piano.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well let's say good at mathematics, to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well wouldn't this - and I might say I love my subject, I love what I am studying.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, what I am asking is: what is desire? How does it come? Why does it control us so strongly? I mean after all a monk, or one of the Indian sannyasis, their whole idea is to suppress desire, or transmute desire.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well transmute, yes. I would rather use the word 'transmute'.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That is, transmute, there is an entity who transmutes it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. And there is a process of transmuting, a discipline or a training, or something like that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, which is not only a subtle form of suppression, subtle form of organizing desire, or saying desire for god is good.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Desire for riches is bad.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> And desire for possessions is bad. So we are not discussing the objects of desire, whether it is god, whether it is power, whether it is to become a rich man or a prime minster, but what is desire? How does it take shape in us?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well, whether there can be love without desire I am not sure. If one thinks perhaps of some kind of perfect love the notion of desire would have changed so much that perhaps you would have to exclude it. At a more ordinary but good level I mean if I desire to become well educated or something...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, that is a different matter.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> ...then this is a tension between a condition which exists and a condition which does not exist.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> But I am asking not desire to become a good human being, or desire to be a good scholar, and so on, but desire itself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I would, I think I would evade or reject this question because I don't see how one could explain what desire was without thinking of different kinds of desire.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I say I desire for a house, I desire for this and this, so many desires. But the movement of desire, the origin of it. Because we have either suppressed it, transmuted it, or escaped from it, or totally controlled it. But again who is the controller? Who says this is good desire, this is bad desire, this must be pursued because it is helpful, the other is not and so on. It is still desire. Desire for god, or desire for money, it is still desire.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And if someone says one is good and the other is bad, you would come back to saying, all the same it is desire?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes. Desire is important to understand, not good desire and bad desire.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, I am not sure that I would be able to understand it without using that distinction. But let's shift our ground slightly, there is something behind what you are saying.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> You just now said desire involves time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. Well, all right. I am going to withdraw that now and modify it by saying that I think that there might be some kind of desire which does not involve time but where you are completely united with the object of your desire. I think this again is something in Christian mysticism, you might say, that if you desire god and if you are united with god, I mean I don't know what this would mean, then your desire is fulfilled and becomes perfect love.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, but the man who says, "I must become a very rich man", powerful man, it is still desire.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> One is for god and the unification with god, it is still desire.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But you speak of desire as if it were something which you want to overcome or set aside.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No. I want to understand the movement of it, the process of it, the intolerable burden of it, or the pleasure of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, it is not always a burden, is it? I mean if you desire something, for instance if you are hungry and you know that you are going to have a good meal shortly, the intention of desire is pleasurable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, that's understood.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But there is something behind what you are saying which I can't get.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I will go into it. Desire exists only when there is identification with sensation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> By sensation you don't mean...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I see a lovely house, I want it, there is a desire for it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You don't mean that there is an actual physical concomitant but that there is a kind of imagery.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Both.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You image yourself in the house, something like that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Sensation, then thought creating the image of my owning the house, then desire begins.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, well all right, yes. There is a kind of sensory aspect.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Sensory aspect which thought then gives that sensory aspect an image.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> This doesn't mean of course - well one says one desires to be educated, it doesn't mean you are thinking about it all the time, or having sensations about it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Of course not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> It means you are carrying on your life. There would be moments when you have a sensory experience of desire, perhaps. You imagine what it would be like when your education is better.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> The moment when sensation has given shape by thought, then it becomes desire. That is all I am saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes but then...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I am not saying good, bad and all the rest of it, but desire, per se.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But you say that love is different from desire.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Love is desire from pleasure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Sorry. Say it again.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Love is different. Love is not pleasure, love is not desire.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, all right. I would want to think that purified desire - sorry, this introduces another topic which I will just mention it and put it aside. I am also concerned with what you feel about motivation and energy. I think desire is a source of energy. Good desire is a source of good energy, but let's take this idea of love being different. There seems to me a contrast between a process and something which is not a process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It is not a process.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> It is not a process, not. And you distinguish, you say something like, you used some word like creative being, which is to do with the present. And you would connect this with the possibility of love and truth.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Whereas desire is something restless which is outside.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Restless. But love doesn't mean it is static.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> No, static is probably the wrong word here. What would you say?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It's alive, it isn't just a...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> It is creative and...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It is not exclusive. I may love you but I also have this feeling of love. It is not just identified with one person.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But the feeling of love is quite a different feeling from the feeling of desire.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Naturally.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> So you are not excluding the sensory aspect of course?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No wait a minute. Let's go into it slowly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> As we said just now, the brain is part of the senses, part of reactions, action, responses, beliefs, faith, fear, all that is the centre here, which is my consciousness. The content of my consciousness is all that, god, no god, my knowledge, my failure, my depression, my anxiety, all that is that. Now in that there is a great deal of confusion, contradiction, fears, and all the rest of it. Is love part of that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I don't know. You tell me.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> To me, personally, it is not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But then if love is a condition, is a human condition, I mean it is, there is a state of being which is love, or creative being which is love and so a person is sometimes in this condition, are you suggesting that at that moment all the psychological stuff which that person consists of and has collected, is somehow absent?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Absent. Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But still he must know what the object of his love is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No. Just a minute. I might love you. And it is not exclusive, it is not universal, or any of that. It is not exclusive, it is not limited.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, though in a sense it is and it isn't because I mean if one loves a person, you love that person and not another one. But it doesn't mean that you exclude anybody.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Anybody, no. Love is not exclusive.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> No, but it is selective, if one can put it that way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, that word selective, who then becomes the...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> One doesn't love everybody. Perhaps god does...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, I don't want to add love to god or to somebody...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I am using god as a figure of speech. There is an ideal love perhaps.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, I wouldn't even use the word ideal. I don't know. I strongly object to ideas, ideals and all that nonsense. I see definitely love has no relationship to hate. Love has no relationship to jealousy, it is not attached. It is not desire, it is not pleasure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> To ask very, very simple minded questions, I mean let's say that you are interested in another person. I mean after all people come to you.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I care. I care.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. But I ask, do you think there are certain times in one's life when one is - it is difficult - when one is expressing or being love? Should this be every moment of one's life?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I am not sure. I am not at all sure that it can be all the time there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, good, good. Yes. And you think...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Can love exist where there is self-centred interest? That is the real question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> No, it would be imperfect love. Let's leave out imperfect love which is not love.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> All right. When there is self interest can the other exist? It obviously cannot because self interest is very, very small.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You won't let me use the word perfect or ideal, but I'll use love in your sense then. All right. Love then excludes self interest.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Where there is self interest the other is not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. Well you see something that I very much want to find out, and everybody wants to find out, is how to change.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Ah, well!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> How to become, well it is connected.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, wait a minute. This is really an interesting question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> How to move out of the situation, of being envious.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I am envious. There is no difference between I and envy. I am envious, envy is me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. As we were saying earlier, the person is...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I mean envy is me. I cannot act on envy because it is me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes but you can become less envious.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> But it is still me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. Go on. Go on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> So there is no question of suppression, transmutation, or escaping from it, it is me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> What do I do next?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Wait. Wait a minute. I will go into it. If it is me I watch it. I watch it very, very carefully, watch it, not try to act upon it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> So there is a you who is watching the envy?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, watching, there is no you. When you are watching a bird there is no you, you are just watching the bird.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well watching a bird is quite different from other kinds of watching.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That's just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> There are other kind of watching.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Of course. Is there a watching without the word, watching without condemnation, just watching, or agreeing, or rejecting, or resisting.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well there can be such watching, yes, it is difficult. Wait a minute. We have got this envious person, oneself, one is envious. Then one is aware of the envy, one watches it, but just watching.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Watching.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Or being it if you like, put it in another way. Consciously being your envy. Would you accept that form of words?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> You are envy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But you are consciously - when you enviously do something thoughtlessly you are not watching. But then for a moment perhaps...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That is what I am saying. Look, you are watching a precious, intricate jewel. Then you are looking at the extraordinary delicacy, the bright light and the beauty of the jewel.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, yes. In this care you are looking at envy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Envy. I am doing exactly the same thing. Then I see the whole movement of envy, which is comparison and so on and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> So I watch it without any thought interfering with my watching. That requires a great deal of attention, not concentration, real attention in which the self is not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But are you not making a judgement?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You are watching without judgement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Oh no, I have no value. I don't say you must or must not have envy, it is immoral, or anything of that kind. Human beings have lived with envy for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But then is not the result of this attention that envy disappears?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Watching with attention. Watching is attention.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. I like the word attention. You attend in you would say in some non-evaluating way, you are not making a moral judgement. You are not saying. "I ought not to be envious".</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Oh no. That would be too...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But is not, I wouldn't say the purpose, but certainly the result of this attention that the envy dissolves?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, because in attention there is no self at all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, good, good. OK. I mean I understand this state of being.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> You can watch it, you know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But then...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It is great fun.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I mean this connects with my question about how do I change? Is not this...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> This is what we are saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Then this is, if you like to use old fashioned language, a spiritual discipline. No, you don't like the word discipline.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I don't quite like the word discipline because discipline means really to learn. Not to compartmentalize, pursue. To learn watching, not memorize watching, but to see the whole implications of envy, comparison, and all the rest of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And this state of attention would be something which - supposing somebody says, or I say, why not me, but does this happen only when you are meditating, for instance, to use a word which you yourself use? Or should it happen all the time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> All the time, if you are watching. That is, you don't let a single thought slip by without knowing what it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes and this would co-exist with one being a ticket collector or whatever one's job in life is, that you could in fact - the idea of living at different levels, or different states, must I think come in. There would be a state of your being which was this constant attention.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes but you see also you introduce the word meditation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> It is a word that you use yourself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I know. I use that word but you see meditation is a very complex business. It is not - how shall we put it? In meditation there is no meditator at all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> But now what we do is, "I must mediate", "I must follow a system to mediate". "There must be practice", which is all exactly desire, which wants to achieve a certain state.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, this seems to me in a sense unavoidable. I mean I have been taught a system of meditation, a long time ago, and I have practised it to some extent, one practises something like meditation only in a very feeble sort of way. But it does seem to me that there is something which is trying to do it better.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Now when you use the word 'better' that means more, therefore measurable, more and more.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> More like when you say in meditation there is no duality, there is no subject.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Absolutely not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And I would say that something like this happens in the experience of art.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> The moment you say experience you are already...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> All right. OK. Well I mean if I am looking at a great picture, if I am really looking I am not there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> The picture is there, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That's all. When you are really looking at something there is the absence of the self.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And this would be an image of love too, wouldn't it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> There is no image in it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> No. There is no?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> There is no image in love. Image is put together by thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. I think that in a certain way of loving, I mean unselfish love - this is difficult to talk about because love happens in time and you have to struggle and think and plan and do things for somebody you love, but you would be really selfless in all that you are doing, I mean there would be somebody there doing...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Of course. Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But the self would not be present, the object of attention would be absent. But it seems to me you have to try. You have given me the end but not the means.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Let's look at it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Go on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> The means is the end. The two are not different.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> May I just quote a remark made by Kafka to the effect that there is no way, there is only the end. What we call the way is just messing about.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, I see and I don't see as it were.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Let's try something else. You see change implies future, as you pointed out - right? From this to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes and imagining the future.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, yes, the future. What is the future? The future is a continuity of the past, modified through the present, it is a movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, all right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Right? So the future is in the present.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well, go on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> The future in the sense, I mean if I am learning a language...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, that's a good example.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> ...if I am learning a language I need the future, I need time, I need...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, yes. Training, discipline.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Discipline, etc. etc. I have to learn a language. Now there it is all right, but psychologically, inwardly, subjectively, the past, which is me, my memories, my experiences, all the past, is being modified in the present and proceeds to the future - right? This is the whole movement of our evolution, of our psychological well being, or not well being, and so on. So the present is in the future because what I am now will be what I am tomorrow, unless I change now - right? So the present contains the past, the future is now. Right? The present. Now the present is what I am.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, in a sense there isn't anything else, but go on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That's what I am. My memories, all that. And there is no future unless I continue. Is there an end to that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You mean is there an alternative state of being?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes. Ending this whole movement of becoming, struggling, achieving.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes of course philosophers have always been worrying about the difference between being and becoming, and in Platonism, and in Christian theology, being is real and becoming is unreal. And I feel something of this in what you say. But I don't want to mislead myself by thinking about anything else. I mean I am trying to picture what you are speaking of would be like. Let's say you are spending your time learning a language and you don't know the irregular verbs today, next week you will know the irregular verbs. And this is human life and unavoidable and proper and quite right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Quite right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> However during this time you are also attending to everything that you do.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Of course. I am paying attention to everything I do now.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. Now...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> So the now contains...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> ...in a particular manner.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> The now contains all time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I mean you are picturing a possible human state...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, I am not picturing. I am just saying see what has happened to the human psyche: it has moved in this direction always, past, modifying the present and the future. This is the chain - right? - in which we are caught. I won't even use the word 'caught'. This is what we are.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, the word 'caught' though suggests there is freedom, which is another word you use. Freedom which is connected with truth and with love.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And so somebody comes to you saying, "Well I am in a trap, how do I get out of the trap?"</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> If you are in a trap let's look at what is the trap first before you want to get out of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I mean perhaps this is irrelevant to ask. I mean I don't want to get out of the trap in the sense that I don't want to stop wanting next week to know the irregular verbs.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That of course, next week...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> That goes on. But what I also want say, to achieve a state of being which is selfless.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, which means what? Be careful. You desire for it. You have a concept of the future.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. I mean I know that now I am not selfless but I would like to become selfless.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Therefore let's understand what the self is. You can't change - or rather break down the self, or whatever it is, without understanding the movement of the self, not invent a goal.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But in the situation where one was looking at one's envy, for instance, we agreed that one result of this attention would be that the envy would disappear. So the self is changing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It matters not the ending of envy but attention matters.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well supposing I just attended to my envy but went on behaving enviously but with complete consciousness of what I was doing. Would that be a good state?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Then you see you being conscious - that is still part of the self.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well one is not postulating a kind of condition which is totally unlike the human condition. One is imagining a state in which human beings might be.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, we are human beings. We live in this constant conflict, pain, sorrow and all that - right? This is our life. This is our condition. But somebody comes along, you come along and tell me, look, there is a different way of living, not be everlastingly in this business. And you listen to him, find out. You may say it is rubbish and drop it, but there must be a relationship to the speaker and yourself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Like now, I am asking you, of course.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Which means you tell me envy is not love, envy cannot be put aside, watch it, look at it, see it and let it unfold. Don't condemn it, transmute it or deny it or so on, escape. Just watch it, which means give your whole attention to it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But would this not result actually in my inhibiting it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well why not? All right, put it another way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I am bringing it out.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Wouldn't it be good for me to inhibit my envy?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, it will come up again some other time if I inhibit.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, all right. But just meanwhile it might be better.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Ah, I don't want meanwhile!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Ah well yes but you seem to me to exclude the element of training oneself. I mean you don't like the word discipline.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Discipline, Madame, as you know, comes from the word disciple who is learning. Learning. Learning, not memorizing. Learning to see the beauty of that jewel. I haven't looked at the jewel. I have always condemned it, rationalized, etc., but now there is only watching that jewel.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes but what you are watching in this case is something precious, it doesn't matter if it costs a million pounds it is something which is pictured as absolutely precious. Now if I am looking at my envy it is the opposite of a jewel, it is something bad.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, I don't condemn it. There is no spirit of condemnation, or judgement, or evaluation, just watch it. I watch my son. I don't say, "By Jove, he shouldn't be this", "He shouldn't be that". I just watch him. Don't you, say for instance when you look at a picture, I watch it. I see all the light, the proportions, the darkness...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Looking at a picture is a good example for me at any rate in trying to understand what your fundamental idea is here. But it still troubles me that you are suggesting what I would, if I understand you, think was a kind of ideal mode of being, real mode of being in which you are connected with reality. But there remains the fact that one is not in this state, one is sunk in illusion, one is full of illusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That's all. Now I am an illusion. I am illusion. I live in illusion. My thinking, this is my belief, faith, is illusion. Now why does the word illusion, you know ludere is to play, ludere, to play. I am playing with illusions.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Why should I bother? Put it in another way. Why shouldn't I just watch my... if I am a clever person I can watch my envy and be amused by it and continue to behave enviously?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> All right. Carry on. There is conflict in it. There is a certain sense of agony in it, there is pain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Wouldn't you wish, if you saw somebody that you loved in a state of illusion, wouldn't you wish for that person that they should change?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I would go and talk to him.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well then you are suggesting that he should change. You are suggesting moral values.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, no. I would say to him, look, why do you have these illusions?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well to call them illusions is already to make them...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Don't even call it illusion. You believe in god, somebody believes, or some other thing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, well let's stick to the case of envy because that's fairly straight forward. Somebody is consumed with envy, the way some people are you know absolutely, "Oh, he's got that, he's better than me", and so on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I know all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You watch somebody like that and say, "Look why waste your energy and your anxiety on something which is not deeply really important. And you should not be doing it."</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That is if they are willing to listen to it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> All right, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> The moment they are willing to listen to you you have already...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But then you have taught them something.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Ah, no. No, no pressure. I don't want him to change.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I know all good teachers refuse to call themselves teachers.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Conflict is the real root of all this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But supposing somebody was in a completely harmonious state, with lots and lots of vices, what we call vices, supposing they are envious, jealous, violent, angry, couldn't they be such an harmoniously connected person. Supposing they are very successful in everything that they do, would you say that this was impossible?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, you can't be harmonious while with your right hand you are kicking Ireland and with the other hand you are being harmonious.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well, yes, I agree with you. I mean think people assume rightly that an evil man is in a state of conflict and that a good man is harmonious.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> A good man has no conflict.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, and an evil man has conflict. Well this then suggests that there is something that the evil man has made a kind of mistake, there is something unreal about what he believes about the world. So then in making the distinction between good and bad one is making a distinction between...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, you can see for instance a man who is a terrorist, a man who kills for the fun of killing, there is something wrong with the man.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I don't call him evil or good, there is some kind of aberration going on in the poor chap.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> So what you want to produce is an harmonious personality?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, is it possible to end all conflict within oneself? That is the real root of the question. All conflict.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And you would be prepared to drop the words 'good' and 'bad' then, and use the words 'harmony' and 'disharmony'.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> In that sense, in that sense.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I wouldn't use harmony, or disharmony, because the moment when there is no conflict you are whole. There is an holistic way of living.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, but you are still talking about good and evil in the sense in which we normally understand them. You speak of the terrorist, let's picture a very bad man not just an envious man, but a very evil man, somebody who is cruel.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, somebody who kills.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Then one would want this person to...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> If you will listen, if you will change, so much the better. But they generally don't listen.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I think we are reaching the end of our reel.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, we have.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Perhaps we have reached it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I think I would like to go on with this.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Would you like to after lunch?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, perhaps we have to stop now.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes.</p>

<h1>2. When There Is Love There Is Truth and Beauty</h1>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> You start.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I am still trying to formulate some fundamental question which I can't grip or entirely see at the moment. Perhaps I could sort of walk round it a bit and ask one or two different sort of questions for a moment.</p>
<p>You feel - the idea of duty is a fundamental one in most moral systems, philosophers argue about it but there it is. People are taught when they are growing up they are taught duties that they ought to tell the truth for instance, and other things being equal, perhaps if they don't always tell the truth. You shy away from the idea of duty.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I feel responsibility is better than duty.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well, all right, then a sense of responsibility would be a sense of duty, under some circumstances, one could extend the two ideas in different directions, but you would rather call it a sense of responsibility?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, responsibility because responsibility implies care, affection, a sense of communication with the other person, not doing something because you are obliged to do, or disciplined to do, or told to do, but be responsible. If I undertake to build a house, I am responsible for building a house. If I am responsible for my children, I would be responsible completely, not only until they pass out of my house, but I would see that they live properly, brought up, no killing, you follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> There would be no limits to responsibility.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No limits to responsibility.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, I mean perhaps one connects duty with very definite things which have to be done. On the other hand, if you take something like a duty to tell the truth, that's something so fundamental.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Telling the truth is part of my responsibility. I wouldn't be dishonest to myself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well don't let's worry then about the word duty. But this is a case where one's dealing with an aspect of human life which belongs to the continuity of life. Would you say that just by that being so that it is an everyday notion, which is part of the decent moral continuity of a society's life, would you regard it as being essentially different from what we were talking about this morning, from the real thing, and from love?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, yes. I would consider it different.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But I don't see quite where the division comes. I mean I am always trying to build up structures, I want to see where the division comes between ordinary what we would call goodness, or moral behaviour and this fundamental thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Could we start: why are we fragmented? Why do we look at life and all our actions and our business, whatever it is, always this fragment, business, religion, love, hate, you follow? It is all so broken up. Why do we do this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well life has to be dealt with every day.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, but why should I accept life to be dealt with in this way?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I think because to unify it, I mean to have a unitary. You seem to feel that we should have some kind of completely unitary selflessness, which then isn't divisible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, that's it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But then I mean let's say the words like truth and love...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> ...are one. If there is love there is truth, there is beauty.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. This is so, if one is looking at it in a philosophical sense. But somebody...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, in actual sense, I mean if I really love there is beauty in it. One can't be dishonest.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, beauty is a more difficult concept for this purpose, at least I feel. What worries me is the point of connection between the truth which is love, the fundamental truth, and ordinary conceptions of truth as in tell the truth.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Suppose I have lied. And I record that I have lied. I record if I have been angry. That is honesty. That is the truth in the ordinary sense of the word. I don't cover up my lie with lots of phoney stuff. I say I have lied, I have been angry, sorry I have been brutal. I think we are so trained to cover up all this kind of thing, to escape from all this, not being terribly honest to oneself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, well how does this connect with - one of the things which I think you are very much concerned with, is overcoming conflict, and overcoming separatist, and so on, this then does suggest that you make these distinctions between desire and love, for instance, and you then bring truth into the centre by saying that love is truth.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But this doesn't seem to me to connect very easily, and this is where the idea of my idea of purifying desire, or something, would come in. This doesn't connect very easily with ordinary moral life. It looks as if one would have two judgements of morality, you would say he is a good man in the ordinary sense of the word, but is an imperfect man in your sense of the word. And isn't it important, I can't think of a way of putting this, for you, I am thinking of you as someone wishing well to men, isn't it important for you to make connections?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, I see this. Look: I would ask myself, or I would ask my friend, why are we fragmented first.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Oh, you want to go back to a metaphysical question first.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Of course, from there you have to start.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> This is your feeling that we must be right at the beginning all the time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, all the time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, I like this too, in a way, what you say about new, what you want is something new, you used the word new, that is not the acquired collection of what one has but something new.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I mean I have asked the students in many of our discussions: why is it we are fragmented like this, broken up, what has gone wrong with us? After millions of years we are still fighting each other, killing each other, we are angry - you follow what I mean? What is wrong?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well there is a sense of conflict or fragmented, which is bad, which means fighting, but there is also ordinary discursive reason and how we set about getting to know things, which isn't necessarily bad.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, yes, I use my reasons to see why the world is divided into these kind of things, like nationality, religion. You know what is happening in India, the Sikhs, and the Jews, the Arabs, why? Why do we accept this way of living?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well, yes but I think there is a kind of empirical, ordinary answer to this that we can try and stop it by doing all sorts of things, like people do when they talk to other people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> But we don't madame, the fact is we have never done it, we haven't stopped this division. I mean if I had a son, or a woman had a son, a Jew with an Israeli woman, what am I to do, they are fighting?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, Part - you wouldn't deny this, would you - that part of what you want to communicate is something which would have practical effects in politics.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It has practical effects, yes. Politics, religion, daily life.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Which is, I would say look, don't let's start with theories and all that, let's start with why we human beings right throughout the world are so broken up, so divided now, so...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But it seems to me it is partly an empirical question in that you could say we could find out why a certain religion held certain views at a certain time and separated off. One could study Christianity in this way, but there is a sort of metaphysical question, which I would think is partly unanswerable. I mean it is like saying why are there human beings? One must say, well I don't know. I mean people who believe in God would say that God created the world.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> And the scientists have different reasons.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> If you exclude the empirical answer, you are asking a kind of metaphysical question which in a way can't be answered.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I think it is fairly simple. I would like to ask: is it that thought itself is fragmented?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I think thought itself is fragmented. And it seems to me in a sense unavoidably so. I mean what we are doing now, using a natural language and concepts and using words, which we have learnt to understand and so on, this is something which depends on spreading out of interest to the world in many, many different ways. I mean the word discursive sort of covers this kind of notion that the intellect has to spread itself out, it has to emerge into language and so on. It can't be a compact, it can't be one, which many philosophers want. They want this one. But in your objection - you don't seem to me to allow... put it this way, the redemption of the world, I mean the bringing of the world into the centre, into goodness, into truth, love.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I say, yes it must be.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well yes, but then one can't get rid of all fragmentation. One has got to redeem it, if you see what I mean, to get rid of fragmentation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> All right, let's redeem it. Now human beings, why are they like this? Let's redeem that. Not intellectually explaining, but the fact, daily fact, why is it that there is such conflict, such violence?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well again there are many reasons. Take Ireland, for instance, I mean there are many reasons.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Historical reasons why there is a conflict in Ireland. But you are thinking of much deeper things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Much deeper things, naturally.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> It seems to me, well if somebody asks me that I would say I can't answer the metaphysical question but what I can say is why ought it not to be so. And this uses the word 'ought' which you don't want. We have a conception of goodness from which we spread, as it were, all kinds of thought and action into the world - this is putting it very badly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I understand.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Hoping that gradually we can make the world better and remove conflict in the superficial sense, and in the deeper sense too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> We have lived on this earth, according to the scientists and all the rest of it, at least two or three million years, evolved. We are still at it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, we are.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I mean just look what is happening.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And who can say what the future holds?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> The future is what we are now. If we don't do something now we will be exactly the same tomorrow.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes but what we can do now is something very limited really. We can do something to ourselves and we can do something to a small number of people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, but ourselves is the world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And we can also take part in politics, which is a way of doing something in the world.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> But I am the rest of the world, because my consciousness is like the rest of mankind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, you mean that if you can do it other people can do it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> If I change I affect the rest.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, well there is also the fact that one has a very limited amount of time in which to achieve this insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That's why don't let time interfere with this question. I am a human being. My way of life, my way of thinking, my action, is comparatively like the rest of mankind. They may have outward differences, but deeply I am the rest of mankind. I am mankind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well except that you are a very unusual person. But leaving that aside.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, no. I am mankind because we all suffer, we all go through a hell of a time. So I am the rest of mankind, so I am humanity. That is real love.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes but how does this...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Therefore, you see I will show you.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> If somebody says all right, you are just you, you are by yourself, I mean you may be showing what is a human potential.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Come and join me, come and join me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, well.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Let go your petty little nationalisms and all the rest of it, and join me, let's be free and look at the world differently, and not always keep in conflict with each other. Every husband, wife, madame, this is happening every day of one's existence.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, but I can't help putting the problem in terms of how much influence...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> ...can one have. And if one is going to teach people, don't let's think of you and me now, but if anybody wants to influence people in order to bring about the end of this period of conflict, they have to involve themselves in persuasion, in politics. And many people would say, many people do say now to worry about your own soul and whether you are selfless or not is a waste of time, you must simply go and help other people, go and stop them suffering.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Help other people. See what is happening with those people who are helping and those people who are helped.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> You can see it, there is very little. Hitler wanted to help. Buddha said too, mankind suffers, there must be an end to suffering. And look what they have done: suffering is going on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. When you think... sorry I keep wanting to turn it round a bit so that I can get a bit more light. When you speak of overcoming conflict, overcoming suffering...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> ...not overcoming, ending...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> ...ending, yes, are you thinking of a kind of - I mean is this anything like what a Buddhist would think of as Nirvana?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Apparently Nirvana means, from what I have discussed with people, a state in which the self is not. The self in the sense of... Come to that point, don't discuss what Nirvana is, you will find out.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I would understand something like this as meaning that one is in a selfless condition and the denial of the world is the meaningless of all these other things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That is what they have done. Deny the world. But I don't say deny the world. On the contrary, you have to live here.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. I mean if one thinks of Plato's image of the cave that you are in the darkness and then gradually you move out into the light. He also speaks about coming back into the cave, by which I think he means that you find some kind of liberation for yourself but then you have to liberate everybody else as well.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That's the point. You know the whole sense of Bodhisattva and all that, I won't go into all that, but if you change fundamentally, won't it affect the mankind?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You will affect a certain number of people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No. Look: Christianity has affected, how many, millions.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes certainly. I was about to say there are cases, like the life of Christ, whether Christ really existed as an historical man or not, the image of Christ has changed people's lives.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Therefore I am saying through propaganda they have changed - right? They have etc. Now Buddhism has affected the whole of Asia.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, all right, but you would go on to say well nevertheless...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I say let a few of us work at this, then we will change the world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But I think we have had great teachers who have had a great deal of influence, who have, as far as I can see, advocated a kind of selflessness which is not unlike what you are speaking of.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, freedom. Freedom from the self.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> What is one to do? It doesn't seem to me...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Oh no. What is one to do requires sitting down, talking about it, going into it - right? Naturally. And breaking down barriers between us.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> We have come perhaps onto a slightly different kind of question: a question about influence and...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I don't want to influence anybody. That is the worst thing to happen because if I influence you somebody else can come along and influence you too in another direction. But if you see something for yourself it is clear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Ah well yes, that again is something which we agree about, that you have to do the thing yourself. It is no good being told by somebody else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Therefore no propaganda, no programming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> This is some thing which I think theologians are realizing now that you can't have God thrust upon you. I mean whatever the spiritual life is it is something you have to discover for yourself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> In the spiritual world there is no authority.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, I...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> But now everything is that. They want authority, people want some kind of security in authority.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, well I don't myself see any answer to the problem of how the discovery of spiritual truth, or whatever this may be, can change the world. You perhaps have more hope for the world than I have.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, I am neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but I see that unless there are a few of us radically change the psychological structure we are going down the hill all the time. That's all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I agree with that too. If the world lost people who are concerned with what you are concerned with I think that it would lose its centre.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, that is what I mean. There are very few people who are concerned to be totally free from all this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But then you want, to put it sort of bluntly as it were, you want there to be more of such people, but at the same time you reject traditional methods, for instance ideas of duty, ideas of asceticism and so on, which have been, as it were, part of the training of people who achieve perhaps this state.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No. Why should I be trained? If I see something to be true I stick to it. Why should I be trained?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, but I think you have probably had a gift of grace, of what a Christian would call grace, which a lot of people haven't had. What you achieve easily would be very, very difficult to achieve for the majority of people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Perhaps that might be. But I mean after all there must be... all right, if you use the word grace, all right. Be in a state to receive that, which means don't be selfish, don't have conflict, have some kind of inward silence.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, I agree entirely, entirely with this. Yes, I think, I mean don't let's argue about the question of influence or politics, because I understand your position there. I would think, I mean I would feel it is perhaps important to try in certain ways to influence one's surroundings, but I know that this is full of difficulties. I would rather in a way stick to the question we were worrying at this morning, though I don't quite see how to find the way of enlightening myself on this subject. It is partly to do with the question of time and fragmentation, that time is fragmentation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, that's it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> To be free of time, that means no movement forward.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Free and in the truth, and love, and not to be acquiring and not to be planning. Would one, if one had this kind of insight, or however you are going to put it, would one know that one had it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I think one wouldn't know but it would show in your actions, in your daily life.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> But you do accept then that there are two - it seems to me that you are thinking in terms of two entirely different planes. And I am wanting to connect the two.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No. There is the physical plane.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well there is the psychological plane also. That is what we are talking about.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Psychological plane, why should there be division there? Why should there be superior psychology, or lower psychology, it is whole psychology.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. I mean some kind of redemption - I introduced the word redemption.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It doesn't matter, I understand.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> ...of the psychological hurly burly of one's mind seems to me can happen in a quite ordinary way. I mean people wouldn't be puzzled by it, it would just be a natural function.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> You see, to be redeemed by whom? If I look to you to be redeemed I am lost.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, I not thinking of being redeemed in the Christian sense. I just mean by redeemed, I just mean that something which is fragmented is drawn in - I am using an image...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> ... of a centre and of outlying parts. I mean picture - I am all the time trying to discover just where this divide is, you make a divide between say the life of a very good man in the ordinary sense, an ordinary very virtuous man who is being very unselfish in the ordinary sense and done a lot of good to people and so on, between that life and the life of truth.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Ah, that is totally different.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well why is it totally different?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Of course it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I mean it seems to be a metaphysical remark to say it is totally different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> You don't mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I don;t mind. And after all the self is a very subtle, cunning thing. It can hide under prayers.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Oh absolutely.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It can hide under every little action thinking it is noble, I am helping mankind, I am influencing for the good.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I am really a remarkable person admired by everybody - in brackets, as it were.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> So to understand that, what the self is, requires such observation, such daily looking at it, not just say "I am free at one moment" and that is it, but it requires such attention to everything that you are doing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> So you would think that if somebody was entirely absorbed in outward action, as it were, it wouldn't be in truth.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That is a most dangerous thing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> So a certain amount of fundamental quietness, I mean this could be compatible with leading an active life, couldn't it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That silence is not the product of thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. OK that is good.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That silence is not to be cultivated.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, I think I believe in that group silence too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Silence, quietness, inside there is no movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And this would connect with what you say about living in the present?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, and timelessness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> You know meditation is an extraordinary thing if you know - I have talked to various types of people who meditate, Tibetan, Hindu, Buddhists, Zen, you know all the rest of it - it is all a conscious deliberate effect. It isn't something you do for the love of it. You can love and yet be selfish. But I mean in the sense to do meditation without conscious effort.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, I think any means that one adopts towards goodness is likely to become a barrier.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Absolutely.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> It is likely to because one seeks idols. I mean we are idol worshippers.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That is finished. That is not meditation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I mean if one seeks a consolation in the feeling that you are doing something. Yes, but nevertheless doing it could help you.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, I have talked to people who have spent years - please, I mean it - twenty five years and a man came to me who was about seventy, much older than I was, and he said, "I have spent twenty five years in the jungle, wandering over and I have deceived myself all along."</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well he should be congratulated, I suppose.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I know. That shows something.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> He was prepared to say something like that because people don't often admit.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> To be really quiet is something you can't cultivate, you can't get it by practise and all the rest of it. It is your daily life you have to be quiet.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> It comes by a gift perhaps.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No, daily life madame, otherwise what is the value of your quietness, if your daily life is not affected, if your daily life isn't without conflict?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well, of course, I am constantly wanting to say that the connection with one's daily life is a fundamental idea. I mean if somebody claimed to have this quietness but behaved badly in ordinary life I would be sceptical.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I know, so am I.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> So I think my own thoughts on this subject are influenced by Plato and I think, or I feel perhaps that something that you are insisting on, which he also insisted on, is the absolute separateness of this idea of the timeless and eternal. That it is quite separate from what we ordinarily think of as goodness, which is a kind of idolatry.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Yes, idolatry.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> And he uses the images of destroying idols. If you destroy images you destroy idols and you go on. But of course he does picture life as a pilgrimage in a way in which I think you don't.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> No. If I have no images in myself about anything, there is no self in that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. You are really picturing what many spiritual people have thought of as the end of the journey. I mean at the end, except that you want to insist that of course one is already in a sense potentially at the end, that there is only...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> One has to be careful of that too because the Hindus believe there is god, there is atman inside and that give him a chance, peel off your ignorance and then you will be like that! That is an assumption. I don't want to assume anything.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well I think there is a metaphysical - I wouldn't call it assumption because it is something I agree with.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It is an idea. It is an idea.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. This is a metaphysical assertion, or religious - only you wouldn't want to use the word religious because that might be misleading.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> I am only suggesting: a concept which has been cultivated, which has been traditional, and that has no meaning, because, look, I have this concept 'the god is in me' and then I go and kill somebody.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Well, yes, anything involving the idea of a god is of course already in a sense an idol.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> That is all I am saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> We are idol-worshippers, whether it is handmade or mental, made by the mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. Yes, the absoluteness of the division for you, and I think I perhaps see what you mean, I am not quite sure, between the ordinary process of life and this being in the truth which is something which lives in the present in a way in which something eternal must live in the present, if you see what I mean. You must insist on it being quite separate from the worldly idols.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> Absolutely, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> After all man's search has been for eternity. They make an idea of it...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> ...which is not a continuation of time. It is quite different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It is the end of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> Yes. Yes. Well I think, thinking about Plato I come to some understanding of what you have been saying.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti :</span> It is half past two.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Murdoch :</span> I think we must end here. Oh dear, thank you very much.</p>
