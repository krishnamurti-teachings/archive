<h1>1. The relationship between teacher and Student</h1>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Krishnaji, I was wondering if we could talk about the question of the educator, that is, the teacher, both in the classroom and outside, and how he is able to educate having some understanding of what the nature of education is, that is the total responsible for the life of the student and for the life of the community, and for perhaps some understanding of the place of his specific instruction, his specific knowledge in the whole scheme of things, but having only a partial understanding of the depth of things, the reality of things. How is he to proceed to bring about a different kind of understanding in a student, that is an understanding that is not just of the subject but deeper and beyond the subject, a more global understanding?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would you consider the relationship between the student and the educator, what is the relationship?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well so far as the subject is concerned, the teacher knows more about the subject than the student.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And so he informs.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>So he imparts certain information. So that is...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...fairly simple.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Yes, that is fairly straightforward.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But what is more involved in this relationship? You are the teacher and I happen to be a student. What is our relationship apart from the subject and the information involved in the subject? What is our deeper relationship, if we have any at all?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>I don't quite understand how you are using the word 'relationship' in this context. Surely one relationship between the teacher is to instruct and is there any relationship beyond that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If that is all the relationship one has, which is generally what happens in ordinary schools, then it is very simple. You inform the students of mathematics, or whatever subject it is, and you go back home, or go back to your room and forget about the whole thing. But we are not talking of such a superficial relationship, we are talking much more of a relationship where we are living in a community of teachers and students.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Most teachers would say that they have a concern for the student which goes beyond just instructing them in the subject, they are concerned with their well being, with their...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wonder if that is so? Take an ordinary school in England, or in India, or in America, are they really concerned?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I think some of them are concerned but it is very difficult if you have thirty students in your class and you see them three times a week and where else do you see them?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is all, that is what I am saying. If it is an ordinary school there is very, very little relationship.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>But you might want to have some more relationship.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, that is a different matter. If you want it how do you set about it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>You probably have to start a school of your own eventually; or join a school that was moving in that direction: one of the two.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Are you saying it is not possible in this system, the school system that we have just now to have that kind of relationship?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't see the possibility there at all. Take even Winchester College, or any of these Public schools, what is the relationship?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Well you would have thought that in a residential school where the teachers are living nearby and the student is there all the time, that they would be in a position to...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Generally they have rules, you must, must not, and there it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>But surely we have to have rules?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh yes, of course we have to have rules. I am not saying that. But we are talking of relationship between the educator and the student in an ordinary Public school, or even in a Grammar School, it means very little.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>But that seems also to be the source of a lot of dissatisfaction with teachers these days who work in ordinary schools. There is some feeling that they would like to reach out more to the people they are working with but they can't, just because of the physical circumstances.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that what it is? The system prevents it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>Or seems to prevent it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would you say that is so, that is a fact?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>I don't quite see how the system prevents relationship. Surely it would be possible for a teacher to have a relationship with a student if he wanted to.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wonder if it is possible in ordinary schools, in Public schools, or an ordinary Grammar school, is that possible?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Well let's take a teacher in an ordinary school.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. What does he do?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Where he comes to school in the morning and he may be goes to an Assembly, and then...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is a class subject. And he takes it for forty-five minutes in the morning, or in the afternoon, or something like that, and he tells them, and there is the housemaster, and he passes them all to him. And there is the headmaster who protects the whole system of fagging and all the rest of it, where is the relationship possible there? Relationship in the sense we are talking about, in the sense feeling responsible for the student, not only academically but morally, socially, his behaviour, his way of thinking, and so on, concerned totally. He doesn't exist.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>Why not? Why not when they are eating meals, or afterwards?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But we are saying sir it is possible but it doesn't exist.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>It is possible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Anything is possible.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>I know friends of mine who are teachers in an ordinary school, and they are really trying very, very had to build up relationships with the students. But to some extent they are succeeding but always they are limited by the school they are in.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what I am saying. The system prevents it, the modern education is merely concerned with giving information, giving a certain amount of knowledge and helping them to get a career - right? Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well I think ambition comes into it at some stage.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>In many schools, however well meaning the teachers are, eventually they have been there for three or four years, and they want to go on a bit further, they want a better job.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>So ambition comes into it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So at what level are we talking about education, about the ordinary education that the average person receives? Or are we talking, having a dialogue about a school where both the educator and the student feel totally responsible?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Krishnaji, we seem to be talking about education and we don't really have a very clear idea of what that means.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think we have, don't we? First of all they need academic training, discipline - right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You all agree to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>The need scales.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And also we want, or desire, or wish, that they should have social consciousness, socially be conscious of what is happening in the world morally, in behaviour, the way they talk, that is what I consider education. Totally educating the whole human being.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>But attention is given to behaviour and to the moral upbringing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is all discipline, do this and don't do that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I think the question comes in of being on the same level really. About the way what you are saying is conveyed in the sense that you approach it from a position of not being higher or superior to the student but rather you may point something out, but without the implication of a psychological superiority.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right. And also isn't the question here, the student comes conditioned and the teacher is conditioned, both are conditioned.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Both are conditioned.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Conditioned according to the culture and so on and so on. And as far as one observes, one is helping them to conform or fit into the wider or narrower conditioning. Would you say that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Well I am not so sure that I would say that. I would say that, as most teachers would say, they are interested in the moral upbringing in a much wider aspect. Whether they can do it is a different question.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The idea and the fact is different. I would like to be something but the fact is I am not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Most teachers would say they are trying.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what are we discussing, that is what I would like to find out? Are we talking over together the average school, either Public, or Grammar schools, or a school like this at Brockwood, where we are concerned with the total cultivation of man, or the student, and so ourselves. I don't know if I am conveying this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>We have all decided to come here rather than to teach at an ordinary school. So really we have to talk about this school.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So we are talking about this school. Then let's talk about that. Not the average and the people who want to do this but can't and so on. So let's start from here, shall we? Is that it? You all agree?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Yes, let's start.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What are we trying to do here? If we could talk frankly and openly. What are we trying to do?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I would say that we are trying to bring about some learning through understanding, which is not an understanding in a particular area but rather understanding per se, if we could refer to some kind of universal understanding.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would you explain that, I don't understand it. Put it differently.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Generally knowledge is assimilated in fragments, or in parts, mathematical parts, physics, a language, we also do this here, the students learns.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>My question is: what are we trying to do here as a community, as a teacher and the relationship with the student, and the student with the community and with the teacher, together as a body of people, what is it we are trying to do?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well I am trying to work round to it by saying this. In a school, in any school, it is necessary at some point to point things out to others. That is part of one's responsibility, as I see it anyway. Now the significant thing seems to be that if you are able to point this thing out in such a way that it makes sense to the other person, that he sees the point of it, then that also becomes part of his own learning, and it is also part of your learning as well because you have learnt how to convey it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Have you answered my question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>That is what we are doing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, what is it that we are trying to do? Have you answered my question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I am trying to answer the question. I have got it in myself but I can't bring it out.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>We might not be able to get at it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have had the school, you have been here for a number of years, all of us, what is it together we are trying to do?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I think part of what we are trying to do is to actually live together rather than separately.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Actually you are living together in the same house.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Yes but I mean actually we co-operate and work, all that living together involves without necessarily avoiding each other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that what you are doing here?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>It is a part of what we are trying to do.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>Also when you ask that question what immediately comes to my mind is - I don't know how to express it, except perception, to begin to learn at things because we don't know how to look at ourselves, or to look at anything just clearly. We have thoughts, it seems sort of guide-lines with which we look at things. So to learn how to perceive things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what is it we are doing here, not only trying, actually doing? Trying becomes rather vague and rather indefinite. What is it actually we are doing?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>We are looking at the way we live. We are looking at it in relationship and trying to understand how we are, what we are and...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I would say we are working for a common understanding, which is not a personal understanding, which is not an understanding of this person or that, but a common understanding.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>It is very difficult to put into words.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You are being rather vague about all this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>What would that mean? It sounds nice to work towards that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, are we concerned, if I may ask, are we concerned, not only with the present activities of living, relationship, and academics, informing the students academically, and all the rest of it, or are we also concerned about what is going to happen to them in the future, when they leave here. What is their life, whether they are going to be absorbed into the whole mass of the average?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>That relates to it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So are we concerned, that is what I am trying to get at. Not only with the now, the now being good relationship, helping them to understand not only mathematics but understand the whole significance of life, and also be concerned with the future of their lives?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Surely the now is inextricably related to the future. How you look at life now.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's just it. How do they look at life now? How do we look at life now? How do we help the student or ourselves to understand the now, what is happening now?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>I was on holiday last month with two students from this school, and there were two or three children who spent some time with us who went to ordinary local schools, and they couldn't understand the relationship which I had with these students. They kept on asking, "Won't he be cross if you don't do the work?" or "Why don't you call him sir?" And so on. They sometimes just stood there watching us. They couldn't understand what was happening.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I want to get at. Are we concerned not only with the actualities of present living, our relationship with each others, whether it is personal, or whether it is objective, whether we are cultivating the mind, the brain, the capacity to think, to think objectively, sanely and also the sense of protection, all that. And will that sustain them right through life? You follow what I am saying? Or they will be caught in these traps?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>They will be caught after being here.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want to prevent that. If I have a son and a daughter and I send them here. I would say please help him not to be caught in these traps.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well, of course. Some are not caught, but some are also.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want my children not to be caught in the trap, in this rat race that goes on, whether it is in India, here or in America, this perpetual struggle.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>So surely the only way we can help them is to make sure they develop a real understanding of what this struggle is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are we doing that? Are we actually doing that? I am just questioning it. I am not saying you are not. Are we actually seeing that they have this quality of intelligence which is not the intelligence of ideas and all that but this intelligence that will help them to ward off danger, ward off, keep away from all the travail of man - you follow? Are we doing that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>We are certainly trying but we are not always succeeding.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not with every student. Now let's come back. Are we saying that this is the purpose or the intention of this place?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then how do we carry it out?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I don't think it can be carried out in an unfailing way. That is, in such a way that there will be no casualties, so to speak, that is not possible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But I am saying, we understand the basis of the school. Now how do we bring it about?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>I think that is the question we have all been asking ourselves.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am asking you.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>We are attempting to do that but we don't quite know, we are working it out.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am asking you, what shall we do? I leave my daughter and my son here - I haven't got any but if I leave them here. And I say, please sirs, and ladies, it is your responsibility to see that these two are not thrown to the wolves, are not caught in the social machine, or become mediocre, average, unintelligent citizens. I say it is your responsibility. And what shall we do? We work together as a community, as a community of teachers and so on, what shall we do? That's what I want to get at, you are not answering my question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>But we can't help the student if we are mediocre and unintelligent ourselves.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now, so will you wait until you become intelligent, not mediocre and then become the teacher?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>We can't because...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is impossible. I mean that would be like saying, it is too stupid to say "I will wait until I make myself all right and then come to teach". So our relationship then is, I am not totally stupid, conditioned, and the student is, so we both are on the same level - right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Yes, that's very important.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is really important, except when you are giving information about mathematics or history, or language and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Psychologically on the same level.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So psychologically we are on the same level. Now how shall we help each other to be free of our mediocrity?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Can we stay with this Krishnaji, because this is a tremendous thing you are saying.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>We should be psychologically on the same level as the student.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Absolutely. I feel that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Yes, I think it becomes difficult sometimes because when one is older one feels sometimes you have in a sense more experience.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>About what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Well one might say...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait. Just look at it. Sex, drink, smoking, what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>There are other things as well.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>For instance, you may...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Climbing the mountains?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>No, you may also have gone through the war, you may also have been a conscious objector, you may have gone to prison.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now that is a different matter. That is a different matter.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>So you have stuck your neck out in some way probably.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is a different matter. So I am saying, look if we are on the same level with the student, how shall we begin to free ourselves from the results which society and ourselves have imposed upon ourselves? That is the problem, no?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>I am not quite sure that we see the necessity for being on the same level, that we are on the same level as the student.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it is a fact. We, as a human being, one is conditioned - would you agree to that? Then the student is conditioned by his father, by his mother, by his friends, by the society he lives in, and so on, books he read, television, he is conditioned by all that. So the teacher is also, not exactly, but they are both conditioned. Now how are we to help each other to, if I may use the word, uncondition ourselves?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Are all conditionings equal?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Is it possible therefore...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is a good question, sir, let's stick to it. Is there a common factor which is the actual conditioning? You follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I mean as an Englishman you are conditioned in a certain way. And another as a German, or comes from India, it doesn't matter, time, the climate, the food, the language, the television, all those, religion, the superstitions, all that has made him what he is, and more. What is the common factor in all human beings who are conditioned? You follow what I am saying?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>You mean more than the fact of conditioning itself? Or different from the factor of conditioning?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You are an Englishman and I happen to be born in India, what is the common factor in our conditioning? Language, is it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well it could be.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want to eliminate. Is it climate? Food, literature, television, the magazines, go on sirs, don't say, no, no, no. And the upbringing, the tradition, being the British and all the pride in that word, and another born in India he has got the same pride, the same religious superstitions, only he is darker, probably not as strong as you are physically, manners and so on and so on. What is the common factor between these two?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>So you are saying only the form is different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>They might be proud about different things, or they might have different gods.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course but it is the same movement. So if we agree the educator and the students are both conditioned in their own way, and the central factor is to be free of this, to become human beings, not labels. I don't know if one can put it that way.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Yes. So the movement you speak of is a psychological movement, which is common to all. I think we perhaps ought to pause over that for a minute.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously. After all what is the common factor to an Englishman, to a German, to a Russian, or Indian, or an American, the common factor is they all have this enormous sense of ambition. The common factor of fear, the common factor of pursuing pleasure, the common factor of suffering, struggle, anxiety, grief, lack of love, and all that is the common factor between all of us.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>So you are saying now that the educator and the student are...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...in the same boat.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>...are exactly the same.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Exactly the same.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>But the expressions might be different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh yes. You might express it by going to church, and another might express it by going up to his room crying. That's irrelevant. The factor is we all go through the same phenomena.</p>
<p>Now as an educator and as the student, that is the common factor - right? Or would you disagree there? Don't easily agree. If we both of us that is the common factor then we can do something together.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>But why is this so important in education, the fact that both of us may be afraid but of different things? Why is that so important?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because fear, whether it is in the educator or in the student, what does it do? It cripples a human being, it dulls the mind, it creates havoc in one's life. No?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>My daughter is just seven years old and every time I see her again she has picked up things some of which are just making it not easy for her to see straight. So one has to say where do you get this from, and why, is it true, all the time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If we all agree that it is the common factor for all of us, how shall he help each other to be free of all this? That is the function of the educator.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Surely one must want to be free of it first.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, see the dangers of it. One is born in India with all the cultural, religious, climatic values, nourishment and so on and so on, and here you have the opposite, marvellous climate! Good food, you know, sanitation and all that. But you, as a human being, and he, as a human being, go through extraordinary miseries, wars, deprivations, tremendous sense of guilt, depression, you know all that. And if you are an educator, that is his function, say let's work this out, and don't let's be caught in all this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>But is it possible? I think there is also a feeling that in a certain sense may be it is not possible to be free of this?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then you are admitting something terrible. If you say it is not possible then you are caught in this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>But if that is all I know how can I possibly be free of that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If you only know fear don't you want to be free of it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Yes but how can I if I don't know?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But aren't you aware that there is fear?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So don't you want to be out of it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So does the student. He is afraid of exams, he is afraid of a dozen things, public opinion, he may not, but fear is common to us. He expresses one way and we express it another way.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>So now we are saying that we must help the student to be free of his fears, anxieties.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Aren't we, that is my responsibility. Our responsibility as good teachers.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Or we must understand the nature of fear itself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is what I mean.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>So it is not just the student but both of us.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because both are together, we are both in the same boat.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Yes. So the student might help us as much we help the student.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I want to get at.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>My daughter helps me as much as I help her, as well as students.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that what education is? Or is it merely to help the student to become the average, mediocre, clever, cunning citizen, ambitious, greedy, envious, fighting each other, you know, killing each other, the whole modern society?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>But now we have to deal with all the pressures of society because we want to understand what fear is and we want to be free both the teacher and the educator wants to be free of all those things that will make life difficult. There are the pressures of earning a livelihood, of exams.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, here the pressure of earning a livelihood is not for the time being.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well it is in abeyance because very early on the student for instance discovers that examinations are the means to a certificate which is the means to...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So can we find a method, or a way of not having exams, or treating exams as thought they were nothing? 'A' level and 'O' level, the whole business of it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>But if I feel that the only way that I can get a job...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, but we might find out a way of not being afraid of exams, or - you understand what I am saying?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or during the whole term, or couple of terms, or whatever it is watching the students and say he is good enough, you are all right, so as to remove the fear of these beastly exams. Watch him throughout the year, the student, say look, study a little more, encourage him, all the rest of it, so that when the final horror comes he says it is not a horror at all, he goes through. Can we do that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>One does that but seemingly at the last moment so to speak, and the student may feel that it is nevertheless a horror. One has protected him from the horror in a sense, one has protected him from the horror but the horror is still there, the horror is still waiting.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Who invented exams? The Italians? The Mandarins? The people who invented this monstrous system.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>But you obviously do need some exams at some stages, if people are going to build bridges, or be doctors, it has to be clear to themselves and to everybody else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but is it possible to help the student not to be afraid of exams?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>If you really have time to do the teaching properly, yes, you can, I think.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am trying to get at.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I think it is just a fear. I am not sure it is just a fear of exams actually. I think it goes a lot deeper than that really. It is not just a fear of examinations, it is a fear of the future, and fear of not being secure, of not having your exams.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what does that mean? Fear of not being successful.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Yes. I think that is much stronger than any teaching you can do.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So we all worship the god of success.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>That is much stronger.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Go into it. Then we go into it with the student and say, look, what is this whole idea of success? Why has it become so important in life?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>It seems also allied to something to do with self-fulfilment too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All that is involved. I heard the other day, "My ambition is to become prime minister" - no, no, he really meant it, not here. I met somebody and his son was saying that, "I am going to devote my life to becoming the prime minister". You follow sirs? And probably he would.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>What puts that kind of idea into one's head?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Our whole culture is that. A man who is not successful, he is treated with contempt.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>So now we are saying that we are putting ourselves against the whole of culture and society.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Against the whole current of this modern world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>We must be careful here because we aren't just talking about revolution in the sense that it is known about, destroying the system, destroying society, getting rid of exams or whatever it is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I am not getting rid of exams. We are not getting rid. We are trying to help the student to understand the whole meaning of success, what is implied in it, and whether he is going to give all his life to this idea of becoming something in the world. Look sir, it is not only in the physical mundane world, but also spiritually, the ordinary priest is ambitious to become the bishop. And the bishop wants to become the archbishop, or the cardinal wants to become the pope. It is the same pattern.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>For the parents just as much as the students.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>They may be saying if you don't pass your exams you can't stay on at Brockwood another year.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right. So can we as educators go into this with the student and say, do we see the danger of it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>This wanting to be is so deep rooted, Krishnaji.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know sir, that is our conditioning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I mean the educators have it themselves too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>So surely we must start looking as well at ourselves, we can't just point it out to the students.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, we have a dialogue about it with the students. In the course of the dialogue I am freeing myself, and I am helping the student to get free of this goddess! I don't know. I have watched it all over the world this extraordinary phenomenon of success. Be somebody in the world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Are we also suggesting that in our discussion we would uncover something which is of greater value?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Aren't you reversing, sir, the whole way of thinking about oneself? Now we think I must be a businessman, I must be an executive when I grow up, even if I fail I must be the foreman of the factory, I must be the shop steward. The whole thing is this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Is it that, or is it also confused because the person wants to be those things, he is ambitious, and yet he feels perhaps in the back of his mind that he would like to be free, he would like to be less bothered, he would like to have a free life but he is caught.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He would like to but the fact is he is caught by the throat.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Has this dichotomy come about in culture itself?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what I am saying. I mean you are always comparing 'B' to 'A', which begins the idea of success. So can we as educators discuss this or have a real serious dialogue and point it out to them what is involved in it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I am worried by when you say point it out to them, because...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Point it out in the sense I am doing it, I am pointing it out to myself, I am not pointing out to them.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In the course of the dialogue I am aware that I am also pursuing the goddess.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>It seems to come back to what we were saying earlier, which was what Harsh was suggesting staying with, that the student and the teacher are psychologically at the same level.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>But if we both really realize that, that creates a certain atmosphere.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. No, that creates a quality of, you know, an intensity. We are both in the same boat. And that gives us a strange sense of responsibility. It is not I row and you sit still. Or you row and I look at the heavens! We would both like to look at the heavens. Can we educate them that way? Is that possible?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>We have said pointing out but we have not really talked about how we actually work on this.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let's have a dialogue about it now.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Because it is all very well saying we worship success but...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait a minute. I am your student, how will you deal with me? How will you all, five of you, who are educators, teachers, how will you explain, go into this question? Pointing out the consequences, the dangers, how will you show it to them?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>We would have to find out first what we mean by success and what it is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Very simple. To be somebody, financially, bigger car, bigger house, to be somebody. Money, if you can't have money, all that, you are somebody with an enormous sense of information, scholar. Right? Being somebody implies, you know what it implies, whether you are a doctor, whether you are a surgeon, whether you are a prime minster, or just an ordinary clerk, he wants to be somebody.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Perhaps we will have to find out what is behind the wanting to be somebody.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is again, what do you think is behind it? You are teaching me, you are helping me to understand this. We are in the same boat, don't immediately wander off. We are in the same boat, help me to understand this. What is behind all this? Why has man right through the world made this goddess so extraordinarily important?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>It seems there is a desire within us.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Look at it sir, go into it. I am your student, don't just give words. Why has man right through history, it is not just now, right through.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>It seems in some sense to be connected with survival.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right. Security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Because he survived at the physical level and then as society gets more sophisticated, more developed, he feels that he needs to survive at the psychological level also.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And also each one wants to survive. He is only concerned with his survival. Obviously. So I want to survive at any price and my survival is laid out by my success, money, position, all the rest of it. And your's is also in a different way but both of us desire to survive, individually. Family, the nearer family, and then the nation, and so on and so on. The tribal instinct is very strong in all of us.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>It is continued, being reinforced by everything that you do, by how you are educated.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The British, the British. And when you are in France, 'La France', 'La France', of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>And we also seem to make the assumption since we need a physical security, we understand that, we assume that similarly we need a psychological security. We don't question that at all.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We never question psychological security, which may affect our physical security. So...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>You mean by that endanger our physical security?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>Or even if someone is worried to death it works that way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right. So can we being on the same level, at the same time, right, can we convey all this to the students and to ourselves, not verbally, just words but in depth?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>In discussion therefore.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Not just in discussion.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Not just in discussion, but in discussion, in action, in games, in everything you do. That seems to be implied in what you have said there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>In a variety of ways.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It means sir, I am very keen to find out why I worship this goddess, which has so many facets, so many faces. Why? Is it security? Individual? Then the family and so on? Or is there much more to it? There is much more to it, surely, than mere physical survival, as well as psychological survival, there is much more involved in it. Is man nothing but this? You follow? Wanting - the priest wanting to be a bishop, bishop wanting to be pope and so on - you follow? Is this all? That's what we make life into.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Generally by implication that is all.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>So far Krishnaji we have said nothing about a whole range of things: about beauty, about love, about affection.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I purposefully avoided that because as long as I am worshipping this strange goddess I can't have the other. Obviously. I can't love...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>...if I am only concerned with myself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously. I can't see beauty if all the time I am worshipping this goddess.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>But still I hang on to this question.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir it is right through. The painter wants to be somebody. The musician always - you follow? It is right through. So it is like a tremendous mountain which you have to climb, but it is not. If you see the truth of this it becomes very simple.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning we had a discussion with the students only and we went into this question of whether this hall should be used for this or that. It took fifty five minutes to disentangle it! And I said, look, let's find out if you want a room where you can be quiet. They all agreed we must have a room where we can be quiet. They said why not in the library and I said somebody is reading there. All the rest ultimately came to the point where we must have a room where we can all be quiet, or I want to come here and be quiet, each one of us. They agreed. I said from that principle work it out. You follow sirs? Not one begin to say we must have it in this room, whatever we like, jazz or whatever we like. I said, don't offer opinions, let's...</p>
<p>So we continue with this don't we? I think we should. </p>
<p class="right">Brockwood Park, 17th June 1979</p>


<h1>2. We have divided life as the outer and the inner</h1>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Krishnaji, there's a lot of unrest in education these days, and there's a lot of debate, and a lot of people are asking questions about it. But most of these questions seem to be about systems of education and methods of teaching and what subjects to teach. And there seems to be a lot of confusion and none of them seems to get to any point.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don't you think we ought to first enquire, what is education, rather than what subjects, what books, what system, what kind of teachers and so on and so on. Shouldn't we first ask: why are we being educated? The word 'education', we know what it all means, but I mean I would like to know, to ask, if I may, why we are being educated. To fit to a system, into an establishment?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>A lot of education at present is precisely for that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So is that what is education, does education mean that? To conform to the social demand? To a particular culture, technological or otherwise which says you must fit into this, you must conform, or you must find your career, your life, in this particular system. Is that why you are being educated? To have a good career, to have capacity to earn enough money and all the rest of it, is that why you are being educated? As you say, apparently it is so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Well it would certainly seem to be a necessary part of education to prepare a student to earn his livelihood.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Part of it. But even then I question it. Let's go into it a bit more carefully, if I may. One might educate a boy or a girl to conform to a particular culture, social demand, technologically, as a career, which is necessary, and so on, but the rest of the whole human complex existence is totally neglected. Would you say that it is so?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>I think some attempts are made in some ways to try and include that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>But it is hard to see exactly where to go, what to do, it is more of a feeling that education should be more but exactly in what direction is not clear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>It also often involves some form of rejection that the society to which you are going, you see there is something wrong with it therefore you in some way...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is the meaning of existence? Unless we tackle it on a very large scale I don't see how we are going to solve a particular small problem. What is the meaning of human existence, what is the significance of it? If it is merely to earn a livelihood, merely to get a job, merely, you know, it seems so limited, so extraordinarily narrow.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>It is narrow, and yet it seems that those very things are becoming in fact more and more difficult, because of the very structure of society itself and its own momentum.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Over population, yes, need we go into all that? Over population, the destruction of real things, you know, the whole ecology and everything. Is that why we have made life so narrow and limited? As a human being, having been to Oxford or Cambridge, or whatever university, when you have got a degree, a job, and for the rest of your life, until almost you die, you are caught in that because you have responsibility for your children, you wife, you know, all that. So is that all? Apparently that is all. Or if you are slightly inclined to be religious, you go off and pop into a church occasionally and say, "I believe in God" and get on with it. Is that why we are being educated?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>It is about all that is happening at the moment.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know that's what is happening. And we want to improve what is happening - different system, different methods, different way of teaching, and so on, to do what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>It seems that education should be preparation for the whole of life.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The whole of life, instead of merely limiting it to earning a livelihood. I should have thought any serious man who is concerned with education is concerned with the whole of existence of man - man not as an Englishman, a Frenchman, or an American, as a human being.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>You see sir, I think as religion has declined in the West, and generally, universally, often the solutions that are sought among teachers, particularly the younger generation of teachers, are generally speaking political, not necessarily party political, but they are of a political nature. I am suggesting you improve the world by adopting a certain line, or you have a non-authoritarian approach to the actual task of teaching and out of that possibly something better will happen. In other words you try not to frighten the student, or not to dominate him, and in a sense challenge the values of the society you are in, which are consumer values, sometimes going into the army, almost generally having some kind of career.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are saying the same thing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>But this seems to be the level at which it functions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In this meeting are we challenging this whole approach to life?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I think we are.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>So we are asking whether it is possible in a school to educate for the whole of existence rather than just...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, and is that possible?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>And is that possible, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>Because one of the problems is that we haven't been educated ourselves for the whole of existence.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand that, but as an educator, how do you approach this problem? On the one hand you say you must have a career, a job and all the rest of it, and also you say no authority, and also you say we must be concerned with the whole of life. Who is concerned with the whole of life? Not the politician, obviously. Nor the priests.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Not even them.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Not the priests.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Certainly not the priests. Nor the army, nor the engineer, nobody is concerned with the whole of life.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Poets claim to be, but I think that is possibly partial too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And are we exaggerating something which is accepted as an actuality if we are totally concerned with the whole cultivation of man? If we are, what shall we do?</p>
<p>All right sirs. If we have children and we are concerned as parents who are also educators, not just parents and then shove them off into a school, but if the parents are concerned and the professional educators are concerned with the whole development of man, how shall we set about it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>I think the truth is that we, the educators, are not always concerned with the whole.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously not!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Because we have our immediate responsibilities, our own jobs, our careers to look after, and all the problems that beset us.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are you saying, sir, that there is no such group in the world? There may be, which we don't know. Now with the whole of life I mean not only help the student to have a technological job and all the rest of it, but also concerned psychologically, inwardly, how to face problems, to understand the whole question of relationship, love, death, you know, the whole of life. Who is there concerned like that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>It is really very hard to teach if you don't feel like this.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is not only hard, but are there such people? And if we are such people, what shall we do? We have not only to understand it ourselves, perhaps beginning verbally, intellectually, and then making it into an actuality in our lives, but how will you help the student to come to this, to the understanding of the whole of life? Because he comes to you conditioned, he is only concerned with a job, with a career, passing exams. If they don't want to pass exams and jobs, what will they do? You follow sir? What is our responsibility?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I think one responsibility is to ask some different questions from the ones that are normally asked.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are asking each other what is our responsibility?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>For instance one could ask how that society comes about which we see around us, how does it operate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How is society like that? Because human beings have created it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>That isn't obvious to a lot of people. Many people would say that society has created the human being.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Society has conditioned human beings. Are you trying to say society suddenly existed? God created it? Some fanciful deity living in wherever he is and suddenly says, "There must be society" and bang, there is society? Or man has created it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>No, I am trying to say that the conditioning of society could create a human being and many people say that if you changed that society then the human being will change.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That has been tried by the communists, by the totalitarian people of different colour: change society, change the environment, either through brutal means or different ways. But they haven't succeeded.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>But perhaps the response of people who went before just didn't do it well enough. This time we will do it better.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You say we will have such a government who will be efficient to change the outer circumstances, society and all that, and hoping thereby to create a different human being. Is that it? I believe every kind of system to change human beings from outside has been tried.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>I think one has to start from the other end. One has to care for the student.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, that is what I want to find out. Whether you want to start from the outside, outside in the sense change environment, change the culture, change the government, change the whole way of looking at life from the outside, through pressure, through cruel means or pleasant means, and then gradually bring about a different human being. Is that possible? And I believe they have tried every kind of system from the outside: the Greeks, the ancient Hindus, the Romans, historically it is so. And in recent years the communists, in their way, through totalitarianism, have tried to force man to be different. They haven't succeeded. They have suppressed man. They have suppressed human beings to conform to a pattern. But there is always the dissidents - you know the whole history of all that.</p>
<p>So that is what I want to find out. Are we trying to change the human character, the condition of man, from the outside, which is called education in a different way? Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or if it is not from the outside, is it from inside, inside in the sense inside the skin, psychologically, inwardly?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>But there has also been a movement of late which have tried all kinds of things, down to gurus, down to psychiatrists.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Most of the gurus, are they concerned with the transformation of man?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>Well people seem to believe they are.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are you sure sir?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>What do you mean, sir, by the transformation of man? What do you mean when you say, transformation of man?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To free him from his conditioning, from his problems, from his tortures, from his anxieties, despairs and depressions and fears, you know, all the suffering. Have gurus tried this? Or have they said, "Follow this, you will achieve something or other"?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Well, they have claimed that they can free you from this kind of thing. They say, "Come to me, follow me, do what I say, I can remove all your suffering".</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait. That means accept authority. You reject authority educationally here, and you accept authority there. I don't know if I am explaining myself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>That happens. But we ought to try and look at what comes about when you begin from the other way on, which is starting with the person you have in front of you.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can we cultivate the human mind harmoniously?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I am not quite sure what you mean when you say, cultivate it harmoniously.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What I mean by that is not only jobs and careers and all that, but also his mind, the way he thinks, his attitudes, all that. The two streams go together, the outer as well as the inner. Or must they everlastingly be kept apart? Or is there such a thing as the outer and the inner? I don't know if you see?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Yes. Perhaps it is going a bit fast, Krishnaji. If we can see that the outer is the passing exams, and preparing for a career.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Career and living a life of constant struggle.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>What relation does that have to an education based on care, affection, psychological understanding, etc., the things we have mentioned?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can these two go together?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Are they, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what I am asking. Or this division is artificial.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Is it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The outer and the inner. Or there is no such thing as division, but it is a constant moving, outer and inner? I don't know if I am making myself clear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>I think a little more. I am not quite sure what you are talking about.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have divided life as the outer and the inner. The inner is more complex, more difficult to understand, and so we have given much more emphasis to the outer. The outer is physical security, physical well being. I am not saying that that shouldn't be. Physical comforts, the whole commercialism, production, you know, all that is going on in the present world, with their terror, with their tortures, with their wars, everything; that's the outer. And the inner is, beliefs, rituals, gods, the saviours, the gurus, the hope that some day there will be some kind of peace in one's life. So we have these two.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Is that part of the inner life of a student?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The student is only what, when he comes to you? He is conditioned by his parents, by the society, the culture he has lived in, and he comes to you and he is career minded, examinations, job. That's all. It is only very rare that a student says, "Sir, there is something more than this, please tell me what there is." Like the other day the boy asked, "All right, take it for granted you must have a career, but that's not the end of everything".</p>
<p>So are these two divisions artificial, man-made? The one is very complex. Apparently very complex, put it that way. The other is fairly systematized, one wants security, physical security and so that has been the urge right through history, that there must be physical security first. Feed me and we will think about god afterwards! And there are the others who say, "Think of god, be with him and everything will come right. Believe in the saviour and your life will be made easy." So we have kept these two, you know, almost in water tight compartments. Would you agree to that, would you say it is so?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>One of them we talk about much more, and the other is...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...rather shy making.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And rather, one doesn't want to expose oneself too much, so you say "Please, let's not go into that, let's concentrate on this".</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Which is what we have done. We are doing it more and more.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which is what we have done, yes. So I am just asking: is this division emphasized by education, as it is now? Sustained by acquiring superficial knowledge, and keeping the other in a cupboard, occasionally looking at it when an emotional crisis arises and you try to solve it, but that's hidden, secret.</p>
<p>So I am asking are these two streams, one very, very strong, all men are concerned with the one stream and so have given an enormous volume of water to it energy; and the other practically neglected. Even the most religious person is concerned not with the ending of fear, sorrow and all the rest of it, but believing in god, practising certain rituals and hoping thereby to achieve a state of mind, or giving him some kind of peace. You see what is happening? Now I am asking: can these two streams be brought together? Surely that's the purpose of education, not to keep them apart.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Why do you see it as necessary to bring these two streams together?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's also my life, the suffering, the agony, the doubt, the guilt, the hurts, you know, all that is part of my life. Why do you give importance only to this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>But the two are not really separate because...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right, the two are not separate but we have made them separate.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>So doesn't that imply that we need to concentrate on the other one, quite considerably, no?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. One should be educated in both fields.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>But the other one is already so strong, you see. It tends to dominate the other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, what will you do? If the educators were concerned and felt tremendous responsibility that the two must be brought together, I doubt if they want it personally, if they do then what shall we do together? As a group of teachers, as a group of educators, what shall we do together? The cultivation of the human mind is not only in the technological world but also in the so-called psychological and if one may use the word, the spiritual world also. And probably the organized religious people say, "That's what we are trying to do".</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Well, that's what they say but...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, they would say that. Therefore one has to go into the whole question of what is religion. Are beliefs religion, rituals, propagated after two thousand years, religion?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well that is what is understood as religion normally. I think you would have to contrast that concept of religion, or that statement about religion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You have to counter it, you have to find out whether it is accurate or false, or invented by the priests.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>So you are introducing another element which is really some kind of psychological enquiry, or...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...revolution.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>...or discussion among people as to what is the nature of things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. What is the nature of the psyche? What is the nature of a total human being, as it is now? And whether that total human being can be transformed, can be changed? After all you have a student who comes to you, ignorant in the mathematical system, or whatever it is, and you educate him so that he has a different mind at the end of ten years. He is either a mathematician, an engineer or physicist and so on and so on. He will take enormous trouble to do that, through schools, colleges, universities, that is what we are doing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Then we must take enormous trouble too to do the other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The other, now who will do it? You see, who will feel the responsibility, say, "Look, we must do this too."</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Well as a teacher I see the responsibility, the necessity for doing that, but I know my subject and I can teach my subject but I don't know the other myself very well.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So what shall we do? If you see the importance of both, how will you enquire into the human existence, as it is, and whether it can be transformed, whether it can be changed? I should have thought that is education, not merely cram the student with a lot of facts about this or that, but also how to live without problems, without suffering, without fear, without the agonies they go through.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>So you need to start paying attention to your actual life.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>One day after the other, as well as going to classes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So as an educator can you do that? If the educator is not living that, is not himself involved in understanding his own life and he gets up and talks about the other, and the students obviously spot you as being rather shady. Question it, why has man denied the other side, or neglected it, or not be concerned about it, why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>One problem seems to be that we don't really know how to look at something for ourselves. We have always learnt mathematics, someone has told me how to do this or that, and when I am faced with the situation where I have to look at something, and nobody has told me how to look, I am lost.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that the question, is that the problem sir? Just a minute. I not quite sure that is the problem.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>It is also where to look.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it is not that. Why has he neglected this, the other side of man, the hidden side of man?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Earning a living has become tremendously important, it seems the most important thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is security. We will call that physical security. And he is asking, "Give me psychological security and I will go after it". Rather, "Educate me to find total security psychologically and then I will accept it". Is that it? He is seeking physical security, all human beings are in one form or another. And if you assure man that there is also security inwardly then he might pay attention to it. So I am asking, is the whole pursuit of man to be completely secure in both areas?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I don't like to do something unless I know what is going to happen.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, secure. Surety. Give me assurity, a sense of feeling safe, protected, and I will pursue that. They have done that, haven't they? Believe in Jesus, believe in certain forms of religions and you will be safe. If you don't believe you will go to hell. Now, of course, nobody believes that kind of nonsense. So that is what I am asking: is man seeking security in both areas?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Not just physical security but also security in relationships.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, security in relationships so that I will never be disturbed, security not to be disturbed, not to have fears, completely safe. In this field he is demanding it, in the physical field, in the other also he is demanding it, and so he has created the churches, the gods, the whole religious structure, with their fanciful, romantic mysticism, all that. Is that what man is seeking? And therefore if you, as an educator say, I will give you security there, completely, in your relationships you will be safe, you will have no psychological problems, you will have no fear, no anxiety, no guilt, no sense of being hurt, you will understand death and so on, then he will follow that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Can we really do that for them?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, that's what I am asking.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Is it possible to have complete security?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Then aren't you offering me the same thing?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. I am not. First of all I question the whole urge, structure of security. Is there security in this field, in the field of technology, in the field of career, in the field of jobs and so on and so on, is there security there?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>There is a kind of security but it brings with it its own dangers.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Its own problems, its own mess, which is not security. Security means to be perfectly safe. Right? Perfectly protected, not disturbed, say, "I have a job and nothing is going to happen". No wars, because the moment there is war I am lost.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Whether nobody is going to take my job from me.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But we want it there, and we are not finding it there. Governments change, inflation, every form of dishonesty. So I am asking: when we say we want security, is there such a thing at all? As long as we call ourselves Englishmen, Frenchmen, you know, keep it isolated, keep ourselves isolated as divisions, nations and so on, races, we are not secure. What do you say to that? Because I want to be secure as an Englishman, if I am an Englishman, or an Indian, or a Japanese, or whatever it is, I want to be secure in my job, you know, physically.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>The solutions that are sought also tend to be bigger but of a similar kind. For instance, like a European parliament, or a European nation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In the meantime, when that comes into being, in the meantime I go through agony, fears, uncertainty. There are millions of unemployed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I would like to get back to the question of the teacher in a school meeting a student who is the product of the society but who is not aware that he is the product of the society.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So I have to help him not to be a product of the society.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Or show him he is a product of society.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He is, obviously.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>He probably doesn't see that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He doesn't. As an educator it is my responsibility. That he is the result of his father and whole generations past, with their particular form of society handed down through tradition.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>And also the present society with its own violence etc.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So he comes conditioned and the teacher comes conditioned - right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>So they are both conditioned.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Both conditioned. At present not realizing both are conditioned, it is the blind leading the blind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>If one realizes he is conditioned he is only partly blind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Partly. But being partly blind isn't...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Isn't much good!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>What makes us insecure?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Division. Division of people into races, classes, nationalities, I am a Jew, you are an Arab. This division.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Well we seem to encourage this division. In schools there is competition.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Naturally sir, because each person is concerned with his own security. That security is through small groups, large groups, identifying with one country against another, which eventually breeds wars. We never say, "Look, we are one human race, for god's sake let's all work together and create a different world."</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>So trying to find one's own security makes everyone insecure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously. Look at what is happening. The politician wants to be secure in his position.</p>
<p>Sir, we are just asking, as educators, what shall we do, or what is our responsibility when we see how grotesque it has all become. It is like developing a right arm and neglecting the left arm, which is withering, which is ultimately going to be destroyed, the whole human being. So if you see both arms must be developed, strengthened and work together, what shall we do? Would you ask that question: what shall we do if you saw the importance that the inward as well as the outer much move together?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I would certainly bring some deliberate attention to bear on it, spend some time with it, talk about it, even understanding it imperfectly myself because of the crucial nature of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can you do that, sir? Will you in a class give half of your time? Half an hour for mathematics and half an hour talking over the other? Discussing, having a dialogue, pointing out the importance of both?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Or rather than separating them out like that, as you talk about the mathematics you are also looking at your responses to it, how the other is moving at the same time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I am saying something more than that. Will you in your class, or whatever you are doing as an educator give time to this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Isn't it rather artificial to divide the class into half for the subject and half for the other?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It may be artificial. How will you do it? Will you do it at lunch time?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Well surely as Harsh suggested by the very working together at a subject you are also working together with the relationship of the student and you. It is not just working on a subject.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That means you have established a relationship with the student.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Have you a relationship with the student? That means relationship being concerned about his dress, the way he walks, the way he talks, the language he uses, cultivating his taste, manners, politeness, the whole of it. Help him to be free, help him to be free from fear and so on. Are we doing this? Which means the educator must also be enquiring himself. Or is this all so vague and uncertain and doubtful when the educator himself is conditioned to one way of life?</p>
<p>What would you do sirs if you had children of your own? After all the students are your children. What would you do actually? </p>
<p class="right">Brockwood Park 20th June 1979</p>

<h1>3. The art of listening</h1>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I was wondering if we could consider perhaps the time span in which a student is in a school like Brockwood, say a time span of about four years, beginning at 14 and perhaps leaving at 18, and how this relates to what we were saying the other day about wanting success and some form of achievement related to psychological security, and what the interrelationship is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are you saying what is the relationship between the student and the educator when they both realize, or the educator points it out to the student that they both are conditioned - conditioned being according to their ecological, cultural, economic, racial, and all that kind of conditioning - what is the relationship between the student and the educator when they both realize that they are conditioned? Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>That's the question.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is the relationship when you and I, I the student, you the teacher, realize that we are both conditioned, and we have a short period, a period of four or five years...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>...in which to work it out.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...in which to work it out. Now...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Is this something that we work out over a period of time, bit by bit?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I doubt it. That's what I want to get at. I question whether time has any importance in this investigation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>We had better say what we mean about time then, because it is obvious that the student is here for a span of time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A span of time being from fourteen to eighteen. Four years, or five years. Or if you have a longer period from fourteen to twenty and so on. No, I would like to question, or ask, what is the relationship between the educator and the person to be educated - educated in quotes - what is the relationship between the two? Not theoretically but actually. What is your relationship as a teacher to the student, with the student when you and he realize that both are conditioned? What is the quality of relationship? And then we can discuss whether time is necessary, a longer time or a shorter time and so on. I think that is an important thing to find out. What is one's relationship when two people realize that they are conditioned - may be conditioned culturally differently, but essentially, deeply conditioned.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>These people are also interested in living a life that's...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They say, is it possible - no, before I say, is it possible, I want to find out what is the relationship between you and me when we realize that we are conditioned?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I am not sure I quite understand the question, when you say: what is the relationship?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Before our relationship was, a teacher talking down to the student, informing him, not about himself, about the subject which he is teaching. But here we are asking, apart from that, because we are concerned with the total development of a human being. That's what we began with. And we asked, what is the relationship when two people realize that they are conditioned - realize, not verbally but actually? And this conditioning keeps people apart. You understand my question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>If I am conditioned as the teacher then I can't actually help.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not as a teacher but as a human being you are conditioned. And so is the other human being, what is the relationship between you two?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>We are both the same, surely.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but I said when you realize.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>From that point onwards you can begin to work together.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, not only work together, but before we work together what takes place, emotionally, intellectually and all the rest of it, when you and I realize that we are both conditioned?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>First I lose my fear of you.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And also - go a little deeper. What takes place between us?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>It seems somehow or other that our images of each other are broken down.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. We don't react as we did before. Would that be right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>You really start listening to the other person a bit.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are beginning to listen to each other. There is...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Is that because I don't feel superior to you?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, we both are in the same boat. We both are conditioned. You realize - realize, you understand, not just verbally have understood what the conditioning is intellectually means, but actually realize that you are conditioned, and another also realizes equally, then what takes place? Our reactions don't carry us away.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I think that in that particular relationship that is so. But the difficulty arises when one realizes he is conditioned...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...and the other doesn't. But we are helping the student and ourselves to realize that we are conditioned. Let us put it this way: part of our conditioning is to react instantly. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>To whatever happens.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To whatever happens, to your words, to your gesture, to your language. Our conditioning is part of our self-centredness. And when you and I realize we are so terribly self-centred, then what takes place? It is obvious. No?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I am not sure it is so obvious. Are you suggesting that there is nothing left to achieve?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Look sir, you and I have to live in the same house. And you and I realize that we are self-centred. That is our deep abiding conditioning. You are self-centred and so am I. And we both realize it. Both have to live in the same room, same house. What takes place? What is the difficulty?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>You have to be very careful because this hardly ever actually happens.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what I am going to establish with the student. I want him to realize, I want to help him to realize that he is conditioned. And in explaining what conditioning is I realize also that I am conditioned. Obviously. Unless I am dull, or anything, I realize the same thing. So we are both together in this. He is conditioned and his activities are self-centred, so is that of another. Right? So what takes place in this actual realization of two people?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>What happens then in the relationship is no longer from the conditioning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it is conditioned, but go on, sir, investigate.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>It is a problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is a problem which has to be resolved.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>But surely it is the communication which is now the important thing, not the...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, communication. Now how do I communicate to you and how do you communicate to me from our self-centred point of view?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Is there any communication?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There isn't any. There is superficial communication. Right? So what takes place? If you realize and I realize, what takes place?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>We, as it were, create the possibility of illuminating this self-centredness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That means what? What is our relationship?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well it is one of equality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is our relationship actually?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Surely we both want to understand and discover together then.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A little more than that. Go into it. What is our relationship?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Then we can deal with each other with affection.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Go on, sir, look at it. You are conditioned, I am conditioned. And we established a relationship of mutual conditioning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>So we both know we are that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what is that relationship, what has taken place in that relationship?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>We have seen something together.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is, we are removing the barriers between you and me. Right? We are removing the division, this self-centredness. Right? You are helping me, and I am helping you - not helping - we are watching each other in order not to be self-centred. That is part of our conditioning. Can the educator convey this to the student and feel the responsibility of this exchange?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>But if we said the two are equal, why is it the educator conveying to the student?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, the student is not so clear as you are.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>But doesn't that mean...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Clarity. I see more clearly than you do. It is not I am superior or inferior. You have more knowledge about mathematics than I have. But if mathematics are used to gain a status, then there is a difference between you and me. No?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>That is true in that field, and it is quite clear. But the conditioning may also suggest to me that the suggestion of being conditioned is a similar factor to being a mathematics teacher.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let's forget for the moment conditioning. What is the relationship between the teacher and the student? What is the relationship, actual relationship, apart from teaching a particular subject? Have you any relationship with your students?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Some of them.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What? Apart from the subject. Now what is that relationship when you realize the fact that you and he are both conditioned, both self-centred - forgive me if I use the word 'you', it's not personal - what is the relationship there?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>Part of it seems to be that we are able to work as mirrors for each other. The student is talking to me and I am able to...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are you doing that now? One has realized that you and I are both self-centred, and do we see our conditioning in our relationship?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Taking place in the relationship?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And it is only through the understanding of this conditioning in relationship there is the possibility of real communication. Communication can only exist when there is no division, when you can both share something together.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>It seems as though we see this sometimes but now always.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, the question of 'sometimes' and 'not always' is - if I may point out - irrelevant. What is relevant is, what takes place in this relationship with the student and with the teacher when they both realize they are in the same self-centred area, field? You are not answering my question. Probably you haven't thought about this. This is what is happening in Brockwood. So what then is the relationship between you and the students here?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>One level of it is like this: I can see such and such a person is conditioned in such a way because of his cultural background - Indian. He is conditioned in a certain way, and another is conditioned in another way. I can see the elements of that, and what has brought about that picture. He may have been educated in a special way but nevertheless when he arrives the whole culture is there with him. So I can see that. And I see that...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now wait a minute. When you see the conditioning in him, how the condition has been brought about do you see at the same time how that very same conditioning exists in you?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I see another form of conditioning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it is still conditioning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>It is still conditioning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's all my point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>But it works out that seemingly these conditionings have affinities. For instance, although we are an international school here, it is very frequent to find that the Americans go to the Americans, the English go to the English, the Germans go to the Germans, the Indonesians go to Indonesians. So their similarity draws them together. In that sense their conditioning is not equal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We said conditioning is not merely the superficial manners, colour, but we went much deeper into conditioning, which is self-centredness. The desire for success.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>And the tribal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And the tribal. We went into that. We haven't tackled this problem.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>When you are talking about conditioning to somebody, it doesn't seem to be their conditioning or your conditioning, you can look at theirs or yours at the same time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>At the same time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>It is exactly the same thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then when you both see the same thing then what is our relationship? Our relationship has undergone a great change.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I am stuck on this point of actually seeing the conditioning as being the same. I can see it as being equal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, all right, equal.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>But being identical.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait, sir. The Indian from India, the American, the Russian, the Englishman or French - the western, eastern and far west, their common factor is they all want success. Right? Obviously.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now the goddess of success has many, many faces. But the central factor is success.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Self continuance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You might seek success as a lawyer, and another seeks success in being a carpenter, or a politician, or whatever it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>How do we distinguish that from interest?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Interest?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Yes. Because that is also one of our objectives in a school like this is to help the student find an interest which will sustain him through life.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that the central factor of life, interest? He might be interested - he might say, "I am really interested in wanting to be a surgeon, that what I want to devote my life" - is that interest the central factor of life? Or is it something much greater than interest?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I am suggesting that the real interest is...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not suggesting anything.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>It seems necessary to have this interest also.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The interest may be awakened by the social demand. Society says, you must be an engineer because you get more money.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>But there may be a talent there also.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh yes, talent. But we are talking of interest. I say, is that the central factor of life, interest? Or ambition to achieve something? I think interest can vary, diminish, sometimes enormous interest, but it is rather feeble.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>It is partial certainly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are trying to get at, aren't we, what is the common factor between two people who realize they are caught in the same trap? I want to move away from conditioning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well they can either...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If they realize they are in a trap they help each other to break the trap.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>But seeing the contour of the trap, to see the nature of the trap is...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, but if you realize you are in a trap, and that causes a great deal of pain both physically and psychologically, and another realizes it, and you two have to live in the same house, what takes place? We are helping each other to break down the trap. And the intensity of that trap, and the pain of it, is making us very active.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Outwardly, you mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Inwardly also.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Would you say this is responsible for the agitation of thought, generally?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Probably. So one's relationship with another is, when one realizes, the activity of relationship in which each one is helping the other to break down, to undo the trap.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>So part of that relationship is trusting another person and not feeling afraid of them.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means what? How will you trust another if one is afraid of them? How can I trust you if I am afraid of you? If you are competing with me for the same job, or for the same whatever it is, how can I trust you? I can only trust when there is mutual responsibility about certain things.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>But we both have to see that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what I am saying. Do we at Brockwood, it comes down to that, help the student to see that he is conditioned, and the teacher is also conditioned, not climatically, dark brown or black or pale, but also psychologically in the sense we are both conditioned to act from a self-centred interest. If we both see it there is a definite change in our relationship, in the relationship between these two people. I think that is very important in a school of this kind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I still wonder what happens if we don't both see it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Therefore it is my responsibility. If you see it, it is your responsibility for me to see it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Are you saying that this will become the dissolving agent which will do away with the particular conditioning? For instance, an English mentality will tend to be puritanical in some respect, either puritanical or in rebellion against that, so it has that kind of trap, kind of seized up emotionally. Or a Jewish mentality could be legalistic, for instance, and see things in those terms. And this come through in the students, the conditioning shows itself, these different aspects of the mentality. So we are suggesting now that if we meet at this common and deeper level then that will throw light on the particular conditioning rather than starting from the other way round.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Through the particular you can find out the whole.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Right. We are suggesting, or at least you are suggesting that that's not the best way to proceed but rather the other way round. Is it helpful then to point out to a student the particular conditioning?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. You see, sir, I am not sure whether a collection of details, a collection of particulars is going to help to perceive the whole conditioning, or to understand the nature of conditioning, the structure of conditioning, the climatic, the food, the religion, the prejudices, the family, you follow, the whole cultural and environmental conditioning. That's why personally I would look at the principle of it rather than the details of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>But in point of fact that is how we attempt to do things here, try to see the particulars first.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>And all the time it makes the person more conditioned.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's why when we were discussing the other day, whether they want a room where they could be quiet, silent, they began to discuss in details. I said, please, if you don't mind, first find out if you want a room like that, a quiet room. If you do that is the principle from which you can work it out. In the same way, can we work this out? That we are, as human beings, wherever we live, we are conditioned by the society, culture, religion of that particular country, or group, or community. And part of that conditioning is ambition, which expresses itself in the desire for success. Success implies security. Right? And so each one is seeking his own personal security. Right? All that is taking place in the world. Or there is the totalitarian concept, the state must be the great success, of which we control it. You know, the whole business of that.</p>
<p>So can we help the student to understand the nature of this conditioning as success. I am only taking that as an example.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>We are taking that as an example because we are interested not just in that particular conditioning but we want to know what the whole nature of conditioning is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Like looking at one particular conditioning we may discover the whole nature of conditioning. I don't know. Right, sir.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>One particular conditioning being...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Say, success, for instance. Or take anything. We will take success because that is what most human beings want. Which when you succeed you have money, position, status, freedom - that is 'freedom' in quotes, and so on. You are respected. So why has success become so important in man's life. We said, in our previous dialogue, security. Right? It does give security. If I am a first-class fiddler, violist, I am a tremendous success. If I am mediocre or not so good I become just part of the orchestra. Even in the orchestra there is competition, the left hand man, the violist is more important than the other fellow. So success is part of our life.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Does success really bring security? Or do we have the idea that it will bring security?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I does in certain ways. Look at all the politicians, they struggle, they campaign, they make all kinds of silly things, all this goes on because they want to be a success, as Prime Minister, or member of Parliament, or whatever it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>But even if you get to the top of whatever you are striving for, it is still shaky, you may fall down any time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The more you strive for success, and the higher you get, nearer to god, in one direction - the popes, the bishops, the archbishops, the whole hierarchical structure of religious people. And on the other side the politicians and the businessman, in every direction it is there. Now what is wrong with success?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>That's what I am trying to say: it doesn't bring you real security. It may bring you physical security, or you may feel wanted, or above everyone, or something like that, but at the end...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is tremendous pleasure in being successful.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>There is, but there is also the fear that that success won't last.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is a tremendous thing to feel, I have succeeded. And you thrive on that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>You fulfil your ambitions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is just it. And you are doing the same, we are all doing the same.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>So we are fulfilling ourselves through some particular role.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And therefore opposed to each other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Do we see that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If you and I are trying to fulfil our ambitions through that particular channel, you are better than me, I begin to be jealous of you, I begin to be nasty about you. You follow. There is division, obviously, conflict between us.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>One might put that down to market factors. For instance, the government wanted a lot of teachers at one time, so anybody who trained could be a teacher, they weren't so much in competition with one another. But nowadays there are not many jobs.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because of overpopulation, you know, all the rest of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>So we are saying that is a market factor.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand all that, sir. But we are trying to find out whether that conditioning which in certain ways is so destructive in our human relationship - right, we agree to that? If you and I are married, or husband and wife, and I am ambitious in one way, and you are ambitious in another, there is no relationship between us. This is so obvious, isn't it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Even if one is ambitious at all.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is just the point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>People are willing to put their relationships second to success.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's just it. That means, self-centred activity is more important than relationship.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>And the whole point about success is that it seems to be at the expense of other people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, naturally. So can we, as educators, convey all this to the student, not verbally, but actually make him realize these things. How dangerous it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>That this is the nature of success, this is what it would lead to.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Division, no relationship. If there is a relationship, perpetual wrangle - you don't love me, I love you - all that kind of thing that goes on. And each one pursuing his own self interest. How can you have any kind of relationship, or love in this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>And also the added factor that if you do become successful and you have that pursuing pleasure you don't want to lose that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And the wife supports you, and says, "Go on", because she gets reflected glory from you.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>But we are saying, Krishnaji, that we want to look at success merely as an example of conditioning, because you just don't want to understand success and put only success away.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, but I see the factor, or I realize what brings about division between people.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I can observe it in the world also which is quite a fertile field, speaking as a teacher. I can observe it in the world as take the map of history, or take the map of current events.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You can see it, sir, you can see it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>In newspapers too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is not only individual success but also it is collective success, national success.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>It is really quite obvious that if somebody succeeds somebody else fails. So somebody feels good about somebody else's suffering.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. So do we as a group of educators see the nature of this: that where there is division there is no relationship. If there is a division between the student and the educator you are educating only about your particular subject. Here you are saying it is different. Here we are actually bringing about a relationship with the student which is not divisive, which has a quality of affection, love and all the rest of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">D: </span>That is what we are attempting to do, but whether we are actually doing that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are not doing it - there is no attempt, either you sink or swim. Sorry!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>You can swim more or less badly. But you are still swimming.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, what is our responsibility in all this? The parents send their children here. First of all, if I was a parent and I sent my children here I would want them to live a life that is whole, complete, not partial. Right? And I say to you, as educators, here are my two children, please help them to live that way, not only at Brockwood but right through life.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>It is quite clear after what we have been talking about. We have to go into the conditioning with them as if it really is the most important thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is the most important thing. Therefore I am asking you, how will you deal with my children - if I have children - how will you deal with them, what is your responsibility? They come conditioned, and the teacher is conditioned, how will you help each other to be free of this terrible trap that man has invented for himself? That's our problem. That's why we said at the beginning of this dialogue, the last two dialogues, what is our actual relationship, is it that of a teacher who is merely concerned with the subject, or he is concerned not only with the subject but the whole way of living, his thinking, his feelings, his sorrows, his ambitions, all that. Are we concerned with all that or not?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>That's what we set out the school for.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I agree. That was why the school existed. So are we doing it? So that is why I am asking, what is our responsibility?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>It is difficult to say if we are doing it when we are actually in the middle of it. But if you ask whether I would like my child to come here, or to another school, I think I would like her to come here because we are trying to do it more than other schools that I know of. Even if we are not doing it as much as we could.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But that is not good enough - more is not good enough.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>I know, but I am trying to say what I actually feel.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know, a little more is not good enough.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Even in answering this question by saying we are trying to do it, aren't we again talking about success?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Are we succeeding?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's why I said, come back to the point: what is our relationship, responsibility in this relationship? If we don't feel responsible in the sense that we are concerned totally with the whole development of the student, not subjects only, then is it possible for both of us to share that responsibility, the student and ourselves, so that we are all working together for the same end. Do you follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I think why we feel hesitant is perhaps that some people are trying to do this and others are not, or maybe one person won't listen, and then you feel that you are not doing it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If you are doing it, and you feel great responsibility in the doing of it, what happens to another who is rather weak about it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>He is either strengthened, or sometimes he leaves.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You burn him out, or burn him in. I don't know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>There are also those who slide out, Krishnaji.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sling them out too.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Psychologically, I mean.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I was going to say, is the task not something like this, which is: to bring about a different mode of seeing things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, a different way of looking, observing, a way of learning, not merely accumulating knowledge, learning, the activity of learning, the mind that wants to learn.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>And so therefore this would not be held within the time frame of fourteen to twenty.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right. I mean, sir, take an example: do the students know what love is? The care of love?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>I wouldn't just ask whether the students know what love is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As an educator do I know it? Or is it all emotional, romantic, physical, sensuous? Which at present it is. So how am I to convey all this to the student? And I feel terribly responsible. Which means first I must help them to listen to what I have to say.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Surely wouldn't that come later in a sense, after you had established a way of seeing together, moving together.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But that is only possible if I listen to you. It is only possible that we move together, walk together, on the same road, if I listen to you first.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>So that is all involved: seeing, listening.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. First I must listen to what you have to say.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>But you are only going to listen to me if I feel fairly passionately and strongly about what I am trying to convey.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Are you saying that love is in that listening?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. If I love you then I listen to you, whether you tell me I am a fool or not, I listen to you.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well what is the relationship of love to silence then?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, that we are going off.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I am sorry.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>I think when you say listening, I think we ought to explore a bit more about what listening means. I mean I can listen to someone who I believe in without necessarily involving love.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I listen. I want to tell you something: I say, human beings are very self-centred. I want to tell you that. Will you listen? Or you say, yes, I know that. That's nothing new what you are telling me. Which means that you are really actually not listening to what the other fellow is saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>So by listening you are saying it is not judging whether it is right or wrong, just holding it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Just listen. Listening implies, doesn't it, a certain quality of attention. No? And if I want to listen to Tchaikovsky, or someone or other, I must attend.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>Sir, I think listening has become something that people don't do: like you put the record player on and work and you do something else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. I am only talking about listening. If I can learn the art of listening I would solve a great many problems.</p>
<p>How do you help the student to listen to mathematics? He is not interested in it. He wants to do something else while you are talking, explaining the problem. And how do you see that he really listens to what you are saying?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Well I might talk to him about what he is doing instead of listening.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, just look at it. If you are passionately involved - not verbally - wholly involved in what you are saying your very passion makes me listen to you.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">C: </span>So that shows him the importance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I mean if you are interested in history, and history is the story of man, anyhow, you say, look, man is you, you are the history of mankind, obviously. And you find out, not merely who was the king, this and all the rest of it, wars, but the story of man which is essentially the story of you. And I am interested, I am passionate about it so he listens to me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>I think he listens when he gets that point, which is that it is the history of himself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>But when he makes that link then...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is what I am saying because I am interested in what you are pointing out. History is the story of yourself - the violence, the hatred, the whole thing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>That is the inner content of history.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but what I am trying to say is, to help him to listen, that is what I am concerned about.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>It isn't a matter of how to listen.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Listen.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">E: </span>It just comes out of the way you are doing things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>To help him to listen you must listen to him carefully.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Naturally. It implies both. Can we do this here? I can't listen - one can't listen if I am prejudiced, if I have a certain point of view I stick to it, I can't listen to you. You may be contradicting the point of view and so I won't listen. But if you say, look let's listen, find out why you hold on to a particular point of view, let's find out. I am interested. I may be holding it, my own opinions may be very strong, I may consciously, or unconsciously be holding on to them. By talking to you I am discovering.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Similarly with inattention, and the other things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. It seems to me I have talked all the time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">B: </span>Krishnaji, it seems we keep coming round again and again and we start talking about success and seeing how dangerous it is. We could start talking about nationalism, or many, many things. But is there a central thing?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes, there is. I don't think we have time to go into that now. Let's stop.</p>
<p>Sir you raised a question, what was it, silence and?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">A: </span>Silence and love.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes.</p>
