<h1>1. Roots of Psychological Disorder</h1>
<p class="q"><span class="q">JOHN HIDLEY: </span> We are particularly interested in regard to the psychological disorder. Perhaps we could start with the question of what is the source of psychological disorder.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, sir. And I would like to ask, if I may, what do we mean by disorder, when the whole world - as one knows, as one sees it from continent to continent - there is a great deal of disorder.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Economically, socially...</p>
<p><span class="tbold">TOM KRAUSE: </span>This is one of a series of dialogues between J Krishnamurti, David Bohm, Rupert Sheldrake, and John Hidley. The purpose of these discussions is to explore essential questions about the mind: what is psychological disorder and what is required for fundamental psychological change? J Krishnamurti is a religious philosopher, author and educator who has written and given lectures on these subjects for many years. He has founded elementary and secondary schools in the United States, England, and India.</p>
<p>David Bohm is Professor of Theoretical Physics at Birkbeck College, London University in England. He has written numerous books concerning theoretical physics and the nature of consciousness. Professor Bohm and Mr Krishnamurti have held previous dialogues on many subjects.</p>
<p>Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist whose recently published book proposes that learning in some members of a species affects the species as a whole. Dr Sheldrake is presently consulting plant physiologist at the International Crops Research Institute in Hyderabad, India.</p>
<p>John Hidley is a psychiatrist in private practice who has been associated with the Krishnamurti school in Ojai, California for the past six years.</p>
<p>In the culture there are conflicting points of view about the proper approach to dealing with one's own or others' psychological problems. And the underlying principles from which these approaches are drawn are in even greater conflict. Without invoking a narrow or specialized point of view, can the mind, the nature of consciousness, its relationship to human suffering, and the potential for change be understood? These are the issues to be explored in these dialogues.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is disorder the very nature of the self?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Why do you say that? Why do you ask that, if it is the nature of the self?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Isn't the self, the me, the ego...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...whatever word we like to use, isn't that divisive? Isn't that exclusive, isolating process: the self-centred activity which causes so much disorder in the world, isn't that the origin, the beginning of all disorder?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>The origin being selfish activity.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, self-centred activity, at all levels of life.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, and certainly that's the way in which the patient comes in, he's concerned about his depression.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Or his fear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>His fulfillment, his joy, his suffering, his...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...agony and so on, it's all self-centred.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, I am asking, if I may, is not the self the beginning of all disorder? The self - I mean the egotistic attitude towards life, the sense of individual - emphasis on the individual: his salvation, his fulfillment, his happiness, his anxiety, and so on, so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, I don't know that it's the source of the thing. It's certainly the way he experiences it and presents it. He presents it as his.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but I mean, if you go all over the world, it is the same expression, it is the same way of living. They are all living their own personal lives unrelated to another, though they get married, they may do all kinds of things, but they're really functioning from an isolated centre.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And that centre, that self, is the source of the difficulty in the relationship?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In relationship.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And the difficulty that creates the symptoms.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And I wonder if the psychologists have tackled that problem, that the self is the origin, the beginning of all contradiction, divisive activity, self-centred activity, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No. I think that the way psychiatrists and psychologists look at this is that the problem is to have an adequate self.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Adequate self.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Defining normality...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The self that is functioning...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Sufficiently.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...efficiently.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means furthering more misery.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I don't feel that the psychiatrists would OJ82CNM1 that at the proper, or properly organized self could get together with other properly organized selves and make an orderly society.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And you are saying, as I understand it, something quite different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which is that no self can do it. No structure of the self can make order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right. The very nature of the self must intrinsically bring disorder.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but I'm not sure this will be clear. How can that be made clear, evident?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Sorry, it seems to me that the context is even broader than that of psychology, because in the world we have all sorts of things which are not human beings with selves, they're animals and plants and all the forces of nature and all the stars and so on. Now we see disorder in nature too. It may not be consciously experienced and a cat that's suffering or a lion suffering or a mouse or even an earthworm that's suffering may not come into a psychiatrist's office and say so, but the fact is that there seems to be disorder and conflict within nature. There are conflicts between forces of nature, inanimate things, earthquakes and so on; there are conflicts within the animal world; there are even conflicts within the plant world - plants compete for light, and bigger ones get higher up in the forest and the smaller ones get shaded out and die. There's conflict between predators and prey; all animals live on other plants or animals. There's every kind of conflict: there's disease, there's suffering, there's parasites; all these things occur in the natural world. So is the context of psychological suffering and disorder something that's merely something to do with the mind or is it something to do with the whole of nature, the fact that the world is full of separate things and that if we have a world which is full of separate things and these separate things are all interacting with each other, that there's always going to be conflict in such a world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So, I'm wondering, is it clear that there is that disorder in nature. Would we say that disorder is only in human consciousness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is, the phenomena that you have described, are they actually disorder? That's a question we have to go into. Or what is the difference between the disorder in consciousness and whatever is going on in nature?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I saw the other night on the television a cheetah chasing a deer, killing it. Would you consider that disorder?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, I would consider that it involves suffering.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Suffering, yes. So are we saying that it is natural in nature and in human beings to suffer, to go through agonies, to live in disorder?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what do you say to that, sir?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, I think that's the way it's looked at by the therapist. To some degree it's felt that this arises in the course of development and that some people have it more than others... suffering - some people are more fortunate in their upbringing, for example, or in their heredity. But it isn't questioned that that may not be necessary in any absolute sense.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Oh.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, that's what we're questioning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what I would like to question too.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Dr. Sheldrake says it is accepted. It's like that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Human conditioning is to suffer, to struggle, to have anxiety, pain, disorder.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, it's certainly...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...human conditioning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>...certainly necessary to have physical suffering. People get sick, they die, and we're wondering whether or not psychological suffering is analogous to that or whether there's something intrinsically different about it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, sir. I do question seriously whether human beings must inevitably live in this state: everlastingly suffering; everlastingly going through this agony of life. Is that necessary, is it right that they should?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It's certainly not desirable that they should.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. If we accept that it's inevitable, as many people do, then there is no answer to it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But is it inevitable?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, physical suffering is inevitable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Illness, death.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, sir, physical suffering, old age, accidents, disease.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Maybe we increase the physical suffering because of our psychological problems.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's it. That's it. Sir, a mother bearing babies, she goes through a terrible time delivering them. Strangely, she forgets that pain. She has the next baby, another baby. In India, as you know, there mothers have about seven or eight children. If they remembered the first agony of it, they would never have children. I have talked to several mothers about it. They seem to totally forget it. It's a blank after suffering. So is there an activity in the psyche that helps the suffering to be wiped away? Recently, personally I have had an operation, a minor operation, there was plenty of pain; quite a lot. And it went on considerably. It's out of my mind completely gone. So is it the psychological nourishing of a remembrance of pain - you follow - which gives us a sense of continuity in pain?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>So you are saying that perhaps the physical suffering in the world is not the source of the psychological suffering, but that the psychological suffering is an action of its own.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Right. You have had toothache, I'm sure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes. I've forgotten...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...you have forgotten it. Why? If we accept pain is inevitable, suffering is inevitable you must continue with it. You must sustain it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>No, we have to accept that it's inevitable, that it happens sometimes. But we can forget physical pain; can we forget the kind of psychological pain that's caused by natural things like loss, death of people?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, we'll come to that. I come to you, I've a problem with my wife, if I'm married. I am not, but suppose I am married. I come because I can't get on with her.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And she can't get on with me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And we have a problem in relationship. I come to you. How will you help me? This is a problem that everybody's facing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Either a divorce...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or adjustment. And is that possible when each one wants to fulfil, wants to go his own way, pursue his own desires, his own ambitions, and so on?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>You are saying that the problem arises out of the fact that they each have their own interests at heart.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it's not interest, it's like - sir, we are all terribly individualistic.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want my way and my wife wants her way. Deeply.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And we see that our needs are in conflict for some reason.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that's all. Right away you begin.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>After the first few days or few months of relationship, pleasure and all that, that soon wears off and we are stuck.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay, that's the same problem then with the mother raising this child and making it her toy. Her needs are in conflict with the needs of the child.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Please perhaps you'll go on, sir. The mother, her mother was also like that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And the whole world is like that, sir. It's not the mother.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So when I come to you with my problem, you say it's the mother.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No, I wouldn't say it's...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I object to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I wouldn't say it's the mother.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, no.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>You were saying that it's a much broader problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Much deeper problem than the mother or the brother didn't put the baby on the right pot, or something.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Right. Then it appears that the needs are in conflict.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I wouldn't say needs are in conflict. Basically, they are divisive; self-centred activity.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That inevitably must bring contradiction - you know, the whole business of relationship and conflict.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because each one wants his pleasure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>There's self-centred activity on the part of the person who's raising the child or on the part of the person who is in the relationship, married. The child is the victim of that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And then grows up to perpetuate it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And the mother's father and mother's fathers are like that too.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes. Now why does it have to happen that way? Are we saying that's the way it is in nature? Or are we saying that...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, I mean, there are certain conflicts in nature. For example, among troops of gorillas or baboons - take baboons or even chimpanzees - there's a conflict among the males. Often the strongest male...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...wishes to monopolize all the attractive females. Now some of the younger males want to get in on the act as well. They try going off with these females and this younger male will fight and beat them off. So they'll be kept out of this. This selfish activity of this one male keeps most of the females to himself. The same occurs in red deer, where the stag will monopolize the females. Now these are examples of conflict in the animal kingdom which are quite needless. There would be enough food for these hens without pecking each other. Now these are not exceptions; we can find this kind of thing throughout the animal kingdom. So I don't think that the origin of this kind of selfish conflict is something just to do with human societies and the way they are structured. I think we can see in biological nature this kind of thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are you saying that as we are the result of the animal, as we human beings evolved from the animal, we have inherited all those pecking order?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, I think we've inherited a lot of animal tendencies from our animal forbearers.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>And I think that many of these show up in these psychological problems.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but is it necessary that we should continue that way?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Ah.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are thoughtful, we are ingenious in our inventions, extraordinarily capable in certain directions, why should we not also say, we won't have this, the way we live, let's change it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, we can say that; many people had said it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know, many people have said it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But without very much effect.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, that indeed is a question. Is it that we're so completely trapped in the ancestry of the past?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or so heavily conditioned that it's impossible to be free.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, there are two possible kinds of conditioning: one is the genuine biological conditioning that comes from our animal heritage, which means that we inherit all these tendencies.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let's accept that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Now that is undoubtedly extremely strong. It goes right back into our animal past.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>The other kind of conditioning is the kind of argument that I'm putting forward, perhaps: the argument, this has always been so; human nature is like this, there have always been wars and conflicts and all that kind of thing, and therefore there always will be; that the most we can do is try to minimize these, and that there'll always be psychological conflicts within families and between people and that the most we can do is try and minimize these...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, accept the...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...or at least make them livable with.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...conditioning, modify it. But you cannot fundamentally change it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes. I'm saying this is a possible kind of conditioning: the belief that we can't really change it radically is another kind of conditioning. I'm a victim of it myself. So I don't know if it's possible to get out of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I want to discuss. Whether it's possible to change the human conditioning. And not accept it, say, as most philosophers, the existentialists and others say, your human nature is conditioned. You cannot change. You can modify it; you can be less selfish, less painful, psychologically have problems, bear up with pain, this is natural, we have inherited from the animals; we'll go on like this for the rest of our lives and for the lives to come. Not reincarnation, other people's lives. It'll be our conditioning, human conditioning. Do we accept that? Or should we enquire into whether it's possible to change this conditioning?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes. I think we should enquire into that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If you say it cannot be changed, then the argument is over.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>All right, so I'll say...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I'm not saying...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I'd like it to be changed, I deeply want it to be changed. So I think that this question of enquiring into the possibility is extremely important. But one of my points, to go back to the conditioning point, is that a lot of this conditioning is deep in our biological nature and people who wish to change it merely by changing the structures of society...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, I'm not talking about that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...are operating at too superficial a level.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Like the Communists want to change it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But the idea that you can do it by just changing environment is what the Communists thought and still think, and in a sense the experiment has been tried and we can see the results in various communist countries. And of course, believers in that would say, well, they haven't tried properly or they betrayed the revolution, and so on. But nevertheless, the basis of that belief is that the source of all the evils and the problems is in society and by changing society man is perfectible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But society is formed by us.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And you, by us is going to be changed, so we have to change ourselves. We depend on society to change us. And society is what we have made it; so we are caught in that trap.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes. Exactly; and if we start off with a heritage which is built in to us, inherited, which comes from our biological past, and if we start with that and we start with these societies that also have bad effects, some of them, and to varying degrees, and we just try to change the society, the other part, the inherited part, is still there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But cannot those also be transformed?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I really...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I may have inherited what - violence from the from the apes and so on, so on. Can't I change that? The inherited biological...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Drives.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...conditioning, surely that can be transformed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, all societies surely seek to transform these biological drives we have, and all processes of bringing children up in all societies seek to bring those drives within the control of the society. Otherwise you would have complete anarchy. However these drives are always brought within certain social forms and individual aggression is obviously discouraged in most societies. But is it really transformed? Doesn't it just come out again in the aggression of the society as a whole, war and so on. So we can see that these things are transformed by society, these basic drives that we inherit.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I was going to say they really haven't been transformed, but I think you're meaning by transformed a fundamental change and not just a superficial change or a transfer of the object of aggression from other individuals to other groups. So if you talk of transformation you would say really that they would more or less go away, right? That's as I understand it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, they'd be changed from one form to another...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I meant...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...that's what I mean.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...I don't think that's the meaning which Krishnaji is using for the word 'transform,' but essentially can't we be free of them, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That's right. Sir, why do you divide, if I may ask, society and me? As though society were something outside which is influencing me, conditioning me, but my parents, grandparents, so on, past generations have created that society, so I am part of that society. I am society.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why do we separate it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I think the reason why we separate it is that there are different kinds of society. And if I'd been born in India instead of in England I would have grown up in a very different way...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...with different set of attitudes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>And because we can think of ourselves growing up in different kinds of societies and we'd be different if we had, that's why in thought, I think, we have the idea that society and me are not exactly the same. We'd always be in one society or another, so society as a whole, all societies taken together, we would only exist within society, but any particular society is in a sense an accident of our birth or upbringing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But even that society is part of us.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Oh, yes. I mean through growing up in it, it becomes part o us and we become part of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But, I want to abolish this idea in discussion, this separation from me and society. I am society, I am the world. I am the result of all these influences, conditionings, whether in the East or in the West or in South or North, it's all part of conditioning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So we are attacking the conditioning, not where you are born or East or West.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Oh, yes. The problem would be conditioning of every kind: our biological conditioning, our conditioning from society.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So personally I don't separate myself from society, I am society. I have created society through my anxiety, through my desire for security, through my desire to have power, and so on, so on, so on. Like the animal. It's all biologically inherited. And also my own individualistic activity has created this society. So I am asking, I am conditioned in that way; is it not possible to be free of it? Free of my conditioning? If you say it's not possible, then it's finished.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, I would say first that it's not possible to be free of all of the conditioning. I mean, certain of it is necessary biologically, the conditioning that makes my heart beat...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, well...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...my lungs operate, and all that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I admit all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Now, then, the question is, how far can you take that? The necessary conditioning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Dr. Hidley was saying - that's his whole point - I am conditioned to suffer, psychologically. Right, sir?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or I am conditioned to go through great conflict in my relationship with my wife or father, whatever it is. And you are saying, either we investigate into that and free ourselves from that, or accept it and modify it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That's right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now, which is it? That's what I want - which is it as a psychologist you maintain? If I may put such a question to you?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes. Well, I think generally the approach is to attempt to modify it; to help the patient make it work more effectively.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why? I hope you don't mind my asking these questions.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No, I think that part of the reason for that is that it's seen as biological and therefore fixed. A person is born with a certain temperament. His drives are the drives of the animal, and I think also because it isn't clear to therapists that the problem can be dealt with as a whole, it is clear that it can be dealt with as particulars.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it - I am not asking an impudent question -</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it the psychologists don't think holistically? Our only concern is solving individual problems.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, they are concerned with solving individual problems.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So therefore they are not thinking of human suffering as a whole.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A particular suffering of X who is very depressed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Right. For particular reasons.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>For particular reasons. We don't enquire into what is depression, why human beings all over the world are depressed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Or we don't try and tackle that as a single problem. We try and tackle it with this particular individual who comes in.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Therefore you are still really, if I may point out - I may be wrong -</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>- you are emphasizing his particular suffering and so sustaining it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Now, can we get clear on that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I come to you.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am depressed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>For various reasons which you know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And you tell me, by talking to me, etcetera, you know the whole business of coming to you and all that, you tell me: my depression is the depression of the world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, I don't tell you that. I tell you that your depression -</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>When you tell me that, are you not helping me to carry on with this individualistic depression? And therefore my depression, not your depression.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It's my depression which I either cherish or want to dissolve.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means I am only concerned with myself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Myself, I come back to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, it's within the context of yourself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Self.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So you are helping me to be more selfish, if I may...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>More self-concerned, more self-committed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It is approached within the context of the self, but I would think that I am helping you to be less self-concerned because when you are not depressed, then you don't have to be self-concerned. You feel better and you're able to relate to people more.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But again, on a very superficial level.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Meaning that I leave the self intact.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Intact.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, well, I feel that people generally wouldn't accept this, that the self is not there, you see, which is what you're implying, that the self is rather unimportant. But rather the assumption is that the self is really there and it has to be improved, you see, and if you say...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's it, that's it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>A certain amount of self-centredness people would say is normal...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...so you keep it within reason, right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Modify selfishness, right? Continue with selfishness but go slow.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I think you're saying something which is very radical, then, because very few people have entertained the notion of no self-centredness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That's right; it isn't entertained.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Maybe a few but...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes. For biological reasons and because of the universality of the phenomenon? Because it isn't even seen as relevant, really.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think most people feel that's the way things are, it's the only way.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That means status quo, modified status quo.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To me that seems so irrational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you must feel that it's possible to be different, you see, at least, more than feel, in some sense there must be some reason why you say this.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why you feel so different from other people about it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It seems so practical, first of all. The way we live is so impractical: the wars, the accumulation of armaments, is totally impractical.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But that wouldn't be an argument, you see, because people say, we all understand that, but since that's the way we are, nothing else is possible. You see, you really are challenging the notion that that is the way we are; or we have to be.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't quite follow this. We are what we are.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>People say we are individual, separate and we'll just have to fight and make the best of it. But you are saying something different, I mean, you're not accepting that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. Don't accept it, but will you listen? Will the people who don't accept it, will they give their minds to find out? Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or say, please, we don't want to listen to you. This is what we think; buzz off. That's what most people do.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, this question isn't even raised usually.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Now why do you think that the self, this selfish activity, isn't necessary?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, sir, first of all, do we accept the condition that we are in? Do we accept it, and say, please, we can only modify it, it can never be changed. One can never be free from this anxiety, depression; modify it, always, from agony of life. You follow? This process of going through tortures in oneself. That's normal, accepted. Modify it, live little more quietly and so on, so on. If you accept that, there is no communication between us. But if you say, I know my conditioning, tell me, let's just talk about whether one can be free from it. Then we have a relationship, then we can communicate with each other. But if you say, sorry, shut the door in my face and it's finished.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So, there are some people who accept it, say we can't change it. But there are other people, and I would say that some of the most inspiring leaders of the different religions of the world are among them, who have said we can change it; there is a way beyond this. Now since religions have wide followings and since their doctrines are widely dispersed, there are in fact large numbers of people in our society and in every society who do think it can be changed. Because all religions hold out the prospect of change, and of going beyond this conditioning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But I would like to know, when you use the word 'religion,' is it the organized religion, is it the authoritarian religion, is it the religion of belief, dogma, rituals, all that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or religion in the sense, the accumulation of energy to find whether it is possible to be free. You understand my question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes. Well, I think the second, but I think that if we look into the history of the organized religions and people within them, we see that much of the inspiration for them was in fact that second kind of religion, which still, within that framework, still survives, I think. But it's also something which has often been corrupted and debased and turned into yet another set of dogmas, conditioning, and so on. But I think that within all religious traditions that this second kind of religion you talk about has been kept alive and I think that the impetus in all great religions of the world has been that, though it's then been debased and degraded in various ways. But this vision has never left any of these religions, there are still people within them, I think, who still have it. And this is the inner light that keeps them going over and above the simple political part and all the rest of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know, I know. But suppose a man like me rejects tradition. Rejects anything that has been said about truth; about god, whatever it is: the other side. I don't know; the other people say, yes, we have this and that. So how am I, as a human being who has really rejected all this: tradition, the people who have said there is, and the people who have said that's all nonsense; people who have said we have found (inaudible) - and so on, so on. If you wipe all that out and say, look, I must find out - not as an individual - can this truth or this bliss, this illumination come without depending on all that? You see, if I am anchored, for example, in Hinduism, with all the - not the superficiality of it, not all the rituals and all the superstitions - if I am anchored in the religious belief of a Hindu, of a real Brahmin, I am always anchored, and I may go very far, but I am anchored there. That is not freedom. Because there must be freedom to discover this, or come upon this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, we are going little bit too far?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>No, but I would then go back and say, well, you put forward the question of a man who rejects all these traditions. You say, let us suppose that I am a man who has rejected all these traditions. I would then say, well what reason do you have for rejecting all these traditions in such a way?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, that seems to be the problem that we've arrived at. We have said that man is conditioned biologically and socially by his family. The tradition is part of that. We've said that that's the problem that we're up against now. Is it possible for him to change his nature or do we have to deal with each of these problems particularly as they come up?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, what I was saying is that the inner core of all the great religions of the world is a vision of this possibility of a transformation, whether it's called salvation or liberation or nirvana or what. There's this vision. Now there have always been people within those religions who had this vision and lived this vision; now...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah! Sorry. Go on, I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, perhaps out of your radical rejection of all religions you've always denied that. But if so, I would say, why? Why should we be so radical as to deny...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I question whether they really - I may be sacrilegious, I may be an infidel, nonbeliever - I wonder if I am anchored to a certain organized belief, whether I can ever find the other. If I am a Buddhist, for example, I believe that the Buddha is my saviour. Suppose I believe that, and that has been told to me from childhood, my parents have been Buddhists and so on, so on, so on. And as long as I have found that security in that idea, or in that belief, in that person, there is no freedom.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>No, but it's possible that you can move beyond that framework, you see, starting from within it that you can move beyond it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That means I wipe out everything.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>It means you wipe it out, but there's a difference between an approach where you wipe it out from the beginning...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>From the beginning, I am talking about.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>And there's an approach where you start within it and go beyond it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see that - wait, wait; yes, I know, the old argument. What is important, breaking down all the barriers at the beginning, not at the end. I am a Hindu, I see what Hinduism is, you know, all the rest of it, and why should I go through number of years to end it, why couldn't I finish it the first day?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Because I think you'd have to reinvent and rediscover for yourself a great many things that you would be able to get through more quickly if you didn't.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. His question is: I am a living human being in relationship with him or with her. In that relationship I am in conflict. He says, don't go about religion and illumination and nirvana and all the rest of it. Transform this, live rightly here, then the door is open.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, but surely, isn't that easier said than done?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know! I know it's easier said than done, therefore let's find out. Let me find out with him, or with you, or with her how to live in this world without conflict. Right, sir?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That's what we're asking.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can I find out, or is that impossible?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>We don't know.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Therefore we start, we don't know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So let's enquire into that. Because if my relationship with life is not right - right in quotes for the moment - how can I find out something that's immensely beyond all this? Beyond time, beyond thought, beyond measure. I can't. 'Til we have established right relationship between us, which is order, how can I find that which is supreme order? So I must begin with you, not with that. I don't know if you are meeting me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>No, I would have thought that you could easily argue the other way around.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Until you have that, you can't get this right; because the whole history of man shows that starting just from...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah! Therefore you invent that. You invent something illogical, may not be true; may be just invention of thought, and you imagine that to be order, and hope that order will filter into you. And it seems so illogical, irrational, whereas this is so rational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But is it possible?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is it! Let's find out.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But you've now completely reversed your argument to start with, you see. He started with the patient coming to the psychiatrist's office who wants to get his relationships right, get the human relationships out of this state of disorder and conflict into something that's more tolerable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I'm not sure this way - forgive me, Doctor, if I'm blundering where the angels fear to tread - I question whether they are doing right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But they're doing just what you said now, starting with the relationship, and not going into these bigger questions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But I question whether they are really concerned with bringing about a right relationship between human beings, fundamentally, not superficially, just to adjust themselves for the day.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I don't think that you're denying that larger questions are involved in that, you are just saying that we shouldn't invent ideas about what a solution would be like.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I come to you with my problem: I cannot get on with somebody, or I am terribly depressed or something dishonest in me, I pretend. I come to you. You are concerned to tell me, become more honest.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But not find out what is real honesty.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Don't we get into the problem of creating the idea of real honesty at this point?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. It's not an idea. I am dishonest. You enquire, why are you dishonest?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Go - penetrate into it, disturb me. Don't pacify me. Don't help me to say, well, be a little more honest and a little more this or that, but shake me so that I find out what is real honesty.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay, that's...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I may break away from my conditioning, from my wife, from my parents, anything. You don't disturb me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No, that's...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's just my point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I do disturb you.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Partially.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, what...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You disturb me not to conform to little adjustments.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, let's look at that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sorry.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I disturb you to conform to little adjustments.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. You don't say to me, look, you are dishonest, let's go into it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I do say that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No but, go into it, so that he is totally honest.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, how deeply do I need to go into it so that I have disturbed you totally?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So you tell me. Do it now, sir.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay. You come in and in our talks we notice that the thing that you are up to is that you are always trying to find some other person to make your life be whole.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I depend on somebody.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, deeply.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Deeply.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And you don't even know that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>So I disturb you. I tell you that that's what going on and I show you you're doing it with me. I show you you're doing it with your husband. Now is that sufficiently deep?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Why?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What have you shown me? A verbal picture...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No, not verbal; not verbal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait, wait.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Verbal picture, an argument, a thing which tells me that I am dishonest. Or whatever you tell me. That leaves me where?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, if it's verbal it just gives you more knowledge about yourself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's all. Knowledge about myself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Will knowledge transform me?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Be careful, sir, careful. Then why do I come to you?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, not so that I can give you knowledge. You come thinking that maybe somehow I have some answers, because the society is set up...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why don't you tell me, do it yourself, don't depend on me. Go into it. Find out, stir.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay, I tell you that. I tell you, go into it yourself. And you say to me...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I can't do it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>...I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So how will you help me to go into myself and not depend on you? You understand my question? Please, I'm not the stage, the only actor. Sir, this is really a serious question. How will you help me to go into myself so deeply that I understand and go beyond. You know what I mean?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No, I don't know what you mean. I understand how to help you go into it without depending on me.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't want to depend on you. I don't want to depend on anybody.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay. I can help you do that. We can discover together that you are depending on me, but I don't know how deeply this has to go.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So you have to enquire into dependence.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why am I dependent? Security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Where is security? Is there such thing as security?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, I have these experiences as I grew up that taught me what security is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, which is what? A projected idea?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A principle.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A belief, a faith, a dogma, or an ideal, which are all projected by me or by you, and I accept those. But they're unreal.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, can I push those away?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes. And then you are not depressed.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah! I am dependent and therefore I get angry, jealousy, all the rest of it. That dependence makes me attached and in that attachment there is more fear, there is more anxiety, there is more... you follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So can you help me to be free or, find out what is true security? Is there a deep abiding security? Not in furniture, not in a house, not in my wife or in some idea - find deeply if there is such thing as complete security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>So you're suggesting that if I simply work on this with you and you come to understand that you're dependent that that's not sufficient because you won't have discovered any abiding security.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Because that's all I want. I've sought security in this house. And there's none, I've sought security in my wife, there isn't any; then I change to another woman, but there isn't any either. Then I find security in a church, in a god, in a belief, in a faith, in some other symbol. You see what is happening? You are all externalized, if I can use that word - giving me security in things in which there is no security: in nations, all the rest of it. Could you help us to find out if there is complete security which is unshakable?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Are you suggesting that this is one of our most fundamental needs?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I should think so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Drives and activities?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I should think so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So indeed it's a fundamental question as to whether this sense of abiding unshakable security is possible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Yes. Because if once you have that there is no problem any more.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>But this isn't clear, because then is it the individual that has that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Individual can never have that security. Because he is in himself divisive. </p>
<p class="right">Ojai 1st Conversation with Bohm, Hidley and Sheldrake</p>
<p class="right">16th April 1982</p>


<h1>2. Psychological Suffering</h1>
<p><span class="tbold">TOM KRAUSE: </span>This is one of a series of dialogues between J Krishnamurti, David Bohm, Rupert Sheldrake and John Hidley. The purpose of these discussions is to explore essential questions about the mind: what is psychological disorder and what is required for fundamental psychological change?</p>
<p>J Krishnamurti is a religious philosopher, author and educator who has written and given lectures on these subjects for many years. He has founded elementary and secondary schools in the United States, England and India.</p>
<p>David Bohm is professor of theoretical physics at Birkbeck College, London University in England. He has written numerous books concerning theoretical physics and the nature of consciousness. Professor Bohm and Mr Krishnamurti have held previous dialogues on many subjects.</p>
<p>Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist whose recently published book proposes that learning in some members of a species affects the species as a whole. Dr Sheldrake is presently consulting plant physiologist to the International Crops Research Institute in Hyderabad, India.</p>
<p>John Hidley is a psychiatrist in private practice who has been associated with the Krishnamurti school in Ojai, California for the past six years.</p>
<p>In the first dialogue the nature of the self was discussed, its relationship to suffering, to society, and to religion. Questions raised were: can one discover or learn about these relationships and is the need for psychological security the root of the problem? Today's discussion continues with these questions.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>We talked yesterday, we started with the question of the origin and nature of psychological disorder, and suggested that it has its roots in self-centred activity which is divisive and conflictual in nature and that biologically such factors as instinctual aggression and dominance drives, the facts of illness and death all contribute. I wondered if we could start this morning, David, by having you comment on the relationship between these biological factors and psychological security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, well, biologically if you begin with the animal OJ82CNM2 they're fairly simple. They exist for a short period while the fact is there and then they generally disappear, leaving little trace. There may be a few cases in the higher animals where there's some memory, but it's in man that the memory becomes very significant, remembering all these experiences and anticipating the future you get a very different sort of behaviour. For example, with an animal he might have a bad experience with another animal and shortly afterward he'll be in fairly good state of equilibrium, but say we have a quarrel between two groups, as in Northern and Southern Ireland, this has been going on for 350 years and there is a specific effort to remember it which you can see going on. And I think this is the biggest difference.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Memory being the...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the effect of memory, the consequences of memory. You see memory by itself would obviously not cause any trouble, because it's only a fact, right? But memory has consequences: it may produce fear, you see, it may produce anger, it may produce all sorts of disturbances to remember what did happen and to anticipate what may happen.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>You mean thinking about it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Based on memory, right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I mean, obviously the animal that's been attacked by another animal remembers in the sense that when it sees the other animal again, it's afraid. It probably doesn't think about it in between.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it can't form an image, you see, I don't believe that most animals can form images of the other animals, and I can base that on experience, that I have seen dogs fighting very hard, and as soon as they turn the corner, the dog sort of forgets what happened. He is disturbed but he doesn't know why he is disturbed, you see. Now, if he could remember the other dog after he turned the corner, he could continue the struggle over territory indefinitely. So the point about territory is, the animal maintains it in a certain limited context. But man remembers it and he maintains this territory indefinitely and wants to extend it, and so on, because of his thinking about it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So, are you suggesting that the basis of the specifically human kind of pain and suffering over and above the kind of suffering we see in the animal kingdom is this ability to remember, to brood over it, to think about it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the animal may have some of that, I've seen examples on television of a deer who lost its doe and it was pining away in the wild, but I think it's limited, that is, there is some suffering of that kind in the animal world but with man it's enormously expanded, you know, it seems limitless. Yes, I think the major point is that with man the thing can build up like a tremendous explosion that fills his whole mind, you see, and it can become the major motive in life, to remember the insult and to, you know, to revenge the vendetta, in families over many generations. To remember that the bad experience you had with somebody and to be frightened of what's coming like the examination that the child may be frightened of, or something like that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But have you answered his question, sir?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which is?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>How does the biological fact of illness or death or instinctual drive result in a psychological problem or disorder?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>By thinking about it. I say that the biological fact is no a serious problem, in the long run, but as soon as you begin to think about it, and not merely think about it but make images about it along with that thought, you know; and to revive the memory and anticipate the feeling of the future; and while you are thinking then it becomes a very serious problem because you can't stop it, you see. You will never attain security by thinking about it, but you are constantly seeking security. You see, the purpose of thinking is to give you security in practical affairs, technical affairs. Now, therefore you are doing a similar sort of thinking, saying how can I be secure against the possibility of suffering again? And there is no way to do that. You may take technical steps to make it unlikely, but as you think about it, you begin to stir up the whole system and distort the whole mental process.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, it seems clear that by thinking about it we stir up the emotions and the associations that are those thoughts, but we're not suggesting we shouldn't think about it, are we?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it depends on how you think about it. You see, this thinking gets to be directed toward giving you a sense of security, you see, an image of security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Right, I get hurt when I'm little or some time along the line and it creates a fear in me and I anticipate that kind of situation. I may not even remember the incident, but I want to avoid it in the future.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and now, the point is this: the mind is always searching for how to avoid it, and searching out thoughts, images, you know, saying, that fellow is the one who did it, I must keep away from him; coming to conclusions and if any conclusion gives you an image of security, then the mind holds on to it, right? Without actually any basis.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Could you elaborate on that a little?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, if you have had a bad experience with somebody, you may conclude that you should never trust him again, for example. Although that might be quite wrong. But the mind is so anxious to have security that it will jump to the conclusion that it's not safe to trust him. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now, if you find somebody else who seems to treat you well and reassures you and flatters you, then you may jump to the conclusion you can completely trust him. Now, the mind is now looking for thoughts that will give it good feelings, you see, because the feelings of the memory are so disturbing to the whole system that its first function is to make the mind feel better, rather than find out what is the fact.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay, so we're saying that at this point the mind isn't interested in what's true, it's interested in getting secure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it's so disturbed that it wants to come to order first you see, and it's adopting a wrong way, as I see it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>The wrong way being?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>To think about it and try to find thoughts that will make it feel better.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>So you're saying the thoughts themselves in some sense are taking the place of reality, that the person is trying to get certain thoughts in his head that make him feel better.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. And that's self-deception, you see.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>What makes you think that the primary drive is for security?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Oh, we discussed that yesterday, of course, but I wouldn't be sure that's the only primary drive, but it's obvious for the animal it's a very important drive to want security, right? We also want pleasure, I think that's another drive - they are closely related.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But to come back to this question of security, in its limited forms, security is clearly one goal that we have. People like to have houses and have them secure and cars and possessions and bank balances and that kind of thing. But there's this factor that comes in, when you've got that, there are two things, actually, that come in: one is maybe the fear that you'll lose it, but the other is boredom with the whole thing and the craving for excitement and thrill. And this doesn't seem to fit within this model of this primary and central craving for security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well that's why I said it's only one of the drives, right? That there's also the drive toward pleasure, as an example, much of what you said is included in the drive toward pleasure, right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I'm not so sure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Excitement is pleasurable and then people hope for pleasure and excitement rather than pain, as a rule.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But don't you think there's a pleasure in itself in curiosity and there's a sense of freedom in discovery that you can get from certain kinds of exploration which is neither just straightforward pleasure, it's not a repetitive kind of pleasure, nor is it security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, well, I didn't want to say that all our drives are caught in this thing, you see, I said that if you think about them and base them on memory, then they are going to get caught in this problem. Now there may be a natural, free interest in things which could be enjoyable, and that need not be a problem, right? But if you were to become dependent on it and think about it and say, if I don't have it I become very unhappy, then it would be a similar problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Could we go into the question, what is security? What does that word convey? Apart from physical security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I would have said invulnerability.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not to be hurt.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Not to be hurt at all, not to be able to be hurt.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not to be able to be hurt and not to hurt. Physically we are all hurt, one way or another: operations and illness and so on, so on. When you talk about being hurt, are you talking about psychological hurts?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, I'm wondering how it is that when a person comes into my office, his complaint is his psychological hurts.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How do you deal with it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I try and...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Suppose I come to you. I am hurt from childhood.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am hurt by the parents, school, college, university...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...when I get married she says something, I am hurt. So this whole living process seems to be a series of hurts.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It seems to build up a structure of self that is hurt, and a perception of reality that is inflicting hurt.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. How do you deal with it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I try to help you see how you're doing it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What do you mean, how I'm doing it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, for example, if you have built up in you the notion that you're one down; or that you're the victim. Then you perceive yourself to be victimized and you perceive the world to be a victimizer. And I help you realize that that's what you're doing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But by showing me that, will I get rid of my hurt? My hurts, very deep unconscious hurts that I have, that make me do all kinds of peculiar actions, neurotic, and isolating myself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes. It appears that people get better, that they realize that they are doing it. And in some local area it seems to help.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, but aren't you concerned, if I may ask, with not being able to hurt at all?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What do you mean by that, not hurting somebody else or not hurting inside of you.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I may hurt others unconsciously, unwillingly, but I wouldn't hurt voluntarily somebody.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, you really don't intend to hurt anybody.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I wouldn't.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, maybe not, but I don't see the connection between not hurting other people and not being hurt oneself. At least I'm sure there must be one, but it's not obvious. And most people's view of the best way not to be hurt would be to be in such a position that you can hurt others so much they'd never dare. This is the principle of nuclear retaliation and so this is a very common principle.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So it's not obvious that not hurting others is related to not being hurt oneself. In fact, usually it's taken to be the reverse. It's usually assumed that if you're in a position to hurt others very much you'll be very secure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, I mean if you're a king or a sannyasi or one of those people who have built a wall round themselves...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...naturally you can never hurt them.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But when they were children they were hurt.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That hurt remains. It may remain superficially or in the deep recesses of one's own mind. Now, how do you, as a psychologist, psychoanalyst, help another who is deeply hurt and is unaware of it and to see if it is possible not to be hurt at all?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I don't address the question about is it possible to not be hurt at all. That doesn't come up.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why? Wouldn't that be a reasonable question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, it seems to be what we are asking here. It is the essence of the question that we're asking. We ask it in terms of particulars only in therapy, and you're asking it more generally, is it possible to end this hurt, period. Not just a particular hurt that I happen to have.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So how should we proceed?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, it would seem that the structure that makes hurt possible is what we have to get at. What makes hurt possible in the first place, not this hurt or that hurt.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think that's fairly simple. Why am I hurt? Because you say something to me which is not pleasant.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, why should that hurt you?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because I have an image about myself as being a great man. You come along and tell me, don't be an ass. And I get hurt.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>What is it that's being hurt there?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There, the image which I have about myself. I am a great cook, a great scientist, a great carpenter; whatever you will. I have got that picture in myself and you come along and put a pin into it. And that gets hurt. The image gets hurt. The image is me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I feel that that will not be totally clear to many people. I mean, how can I be an image, you see, many people will ask. You see, how can an image get hurt, because if an image is nothing at all, why does it hurt?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because I have invested into that image a lot of feeling.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A lot of ideas, emotions, reactions, all that is me, my image.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It doesn't look like an image to me, though, it looks like something real.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, of course, for most people it's very real. But that is me, the reality of that image is me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes. Well, can we get clear that it's an image and not real?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Image is never real; symbol is never real.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>You're saying that I'm just a symbol.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Perhaps.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That's a big step.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>From that arises the question whether it's possible not to have images at all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, wait a minute. I don't think we've clearly established that I am an image.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, let's go into it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I mean, it's not entirely clear. I mean, it's obvious that to some extent one is an image, that when I have a feeling about myself and so on. It's not entirely clear that this is entirely unjustified. You see certain aspects of it may be exaggerated, certain aspects may be unrealistic, but, you see, one approach would be, well, we've got to remove, shave off these unrealistic aspects, pare it down to sort of reasonable size. And then that which remains would be the real thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, sir, are you raising the question, what am I?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, I suppose so, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. What are you? What is each one of us? What is a human being? That's the question that's involved.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, that seems unavoidable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. What am I? I am the form, the physical form; the name, the the result of all education.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Your experiences.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>My experiences, my beliefs, my ideals, principles, the incidents that have marked me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>The structures you've built up that are how you function.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>You skills.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>My fears, my activities, whether they are limited or my so-called affection; my gods, my country, my language; fears, pleasures, suffering, all that is me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's my consciousness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And your unconscious.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's my whole content of me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But there's still that feeling of actuality that me is there, you see, I mean, you may say, you could reasonably argue that that's all there is to me, but when something happens there's the feeling of its actual presence, at that moment.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't quite follow you there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, you see if somebody reacts to being hurt or angry, he feels at that moment that there's more than that, you see, that there is something deep inside which has been hurt, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't quite see. My image can be so deep, that's my image at all levels.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but how...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait, sir, I have an image of myself; suppose: that I am a great poet, or a great painter or a great writer. Apart from that image as a writer, I have other images about myself. I have an image about my wife, and she has a image about me, and there are so many images I've built around myself; and the image about myself also. So I may gather a bundle of images.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Partial.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, you are saying that there is nothing but this bundle of images...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...but you know, the question is, how are we to se this as an actual fact?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But wait a minute, there is something but this bundle of images; and I mean I'm sitting right here, now, seeing you and all the rest of it. Now I have the feeling that there's a centre of action or centre of consciousness which is within my body and associated with it which has a centre and it's not you, and it's not you, and it's not David: it's me. And associated with this centre of action, my body, sitting here, is a whole lot of memories an experiences and without those memories I wouldn't be able to speak, to talk, to recognize anything.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So there seems to be some substance to this image of myself. There may be false images associated with it, but there seems to be a reality which I feel as I sit here.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir,...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So it's not entirely illusory.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...are you saying that you are totally, basically different from the three of us?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, I'm in a different place and I have a different body...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...and in that sense I'm different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, I'll admit that, I mean you're tall, I' short, I'm brown, you're...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...black or you're white or you're pink or whatever it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Now at another level I'm not basically different in the sense that we can all speak the same language and communicate, so there's something in common. And at a purely physical level all of us have a lot in common with each other, the same kinds of enzymes, chemicals, and so on. And those indeed - hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms - we have in common with everything else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Now, is your consciousness different from the rest? Consciousness, not bodily responses, bodily reactions, bodily conditioning; is your consciousness: your beliefs, your fears, your anxieties, depressions, faith, all that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, I would say that many of the contents of my consciousness or many of the beliefs, desires, etcetera, I have, other people also have. But I would say the particular combination of experiences, memories, desires, etcetera I have are unique, because I've had a particular set of experiences as you have and as everyone has which makes a unique combination of these different elements.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So is mine unique?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So is his?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Exactly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The illusion makes it all common. It's no longer unique.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>That's a paradox. It's not immediately clear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why isn't it clear? Everybody's unique, right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, we're all unique.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I question that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>We're not unique in the same way. Otherwise the word unique becomes meaningless. If we're unique, each of us is unique, we have a unique set of experiences and environmental factors, memories, etcetera.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what you just now said, that's common lot to all of us.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, we all have it, but what we have is different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, you brought up in England...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...and perhaps another brought up in America, another brought up in Chile, we all have different experiences; different country, different views, different mountains, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But apart from the physical environment, linguistic differences and accidents of experience, basically, fundamentally, deep down, we suffer; we are frightened to death, we are anxious, we are agonizing about something or other, and conflict, that's the ground on which we all stand.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But that doesn't seem a very startling conclusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it is not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I think what you are saying really implies that what we have in common is essential and fundamental rather than just superficial, you see. And now, I've talked with people about this and they say, everybody agrees we all have these things in common but sorrow, suffering and so on are not so important, the really important point are the higher achievements of culture and things like that, as an example.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Maybe the distinction is between the form and the content. Our contents are all different and they have similarities and differences, but maybe the form is the same, their structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I would say contents are the same for all human beings.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But you see I can recognize that there is such a thing as common humanity but I would regard that quite possibly as an abstraction or a projection rather than a reality. How do I know that is not an abstraction?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because you go around the world, you see people suffer, you see human beings in agony, despair, depression, loneliness, lack of affection, lack of care, attention, that's the basic human reactions, that is part of our consciousness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So you are not basically different from me. You may be tall, you may be born in England, I may be born in Africa, I have dark skin, but deep down the river, the content of the river is the water. The river is not Asiatic river, or European river, it is a river.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, well that is clearly true at some level. But I am not quite sure at what level, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am talking basically, deeply.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But you see it seems to me, why stop there? I can see something in common with all other human beings, but I can also by looking at animals see something in common with them. We have a great deal in common with the animals.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Surely, surely.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So why stop at human beings?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Why not say...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because I say if I feel - I don't like the word 'common' - one feels it is the ground on which all human beings stand. Their relationship with nature, animals and so on, and the content of our consciousness is again the ground of humanity. Love is not English, American or Indian. Hate is not - agony is not yours or mine, it is agony. But we identify ourselves with agony, it is my agony, which is not yours.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>We might go through it in very different ways though.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Different expressions, different reactions, but basically it is agony. Not German agony and Asiatic agony - British and Argentine, it is human conflict. Why do we separate ourselves from all this? The British, the Argentine, the Jew, the Arab, the Hindu, the Muslim. You follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which all seems so nonsensical, tribal. The worship of a nation is tribalism. So why can't we wipe out all that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I don't know. You tell me, why can't we?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because again we have come back to the question: I identify with my nation because that gives me a certain strength, certain standard, certain status, certain security. When I say, "I am British"! This division is one of the reasons of war, not only economic, social and all the rest of it, but nationalism, which is really glorified tribalism, is the cause of war. Why can't we wipe that out? It seems so reasonable.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It seems reasonable on a level like nationalism, people don't think they are England.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Start from there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay. But then I have a patient and he does think that he is married, and that it is his wife.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course it is his wife.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, isn't that the same action that you are talking about?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. Sir, just let's go into it slowly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why do I want to identify myself with something greater?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Because I am not sufficient.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Like nationalism, like god.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I don't feel sufficient.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Insecure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Insecure, insufficient, lonely, isolated, I have built a wall round myself. So all this is making me desperately lonely. And out of that conscious, or unconscious loneliness I identify with god, with the nation, with Mussolini, it doesn't matter, Hitler, or any religious teacher.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay. Or I get married, I have a child, I make a place for myself. And that's all also identification.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Why do we want to identify with something? No, the basic question is too, why do we want roots?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>To belong.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To belong, in which is also implied to become. So this whole process of becoming, from childhood I am asked to become, become, become. From the priest to the bishop, the bishop to the cardinal, the cardinal to the pope. And in the business world it is the same. In the spiritual world it is the same. I am this but I must become that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay, what I am is not sufficient.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why do we want to become? What is it that is becoming?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well the obvious reason for wanting to become is a feeling of insufficiency, inadequacy, in the state that we are. And one of the reasons for this is that we live in an imperfect world, our relationship with other people are imperfect. We are not content for a variety of reasons with the way we are. So the way out of that seems to become something else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That means escaping from 'what is'.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes. But it may seem 'what is' is something we have to escape from.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. Take the usual experience. I am violent and I have invented non-violence. And I am trying to become that. I'll take years to become that. In the meantime I am violent. So I have never escaped from violence. It is just an invention.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well you are trying to escape from it. You may escape in the end.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I don't want to escape. I want to understand the nature of violence, what is implied in it, whether it is possible to live a life without any sense of violence.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But what you are suggesting is a more effective method of escaping. You are not suggesting abandoning the idea of escaping. You are suggesting that the normal way of escaping, trying to become non-violent, is one way of doing it which doesn't work. Whereas if you do another method where you actually look at the violence in a different way you can become non-violent.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not escaping.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, you are changing then.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. I am violent. I want to see what is the nature of violence, how it arises.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But for what purpose?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To see whether it is possible to be free of it completely.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But isn't that a kind of escape from it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Being free of something...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...is not an escape.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Why not?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Avoidance, running away, fly away from 'what is' is an escape, but to say, look, this is what I am, let's look at it, let's observe what its content is. That is not escape.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Oh, I see the distinction you are making is that an escape in the normal sense is running away from something, like escaping from prison, or one's parents, or whatever, but they still remain there. What you are saying is that rather than escaping from violence, which leaves violence intact and still there, and you try and distance yourself from it, you try to dissolve violence, or abolish it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Dissolve.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not abolish it, dissolve it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>All right. So this is different from escape, because you are trying to dissolve the thing rather than run away from it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Running away, everybody runs away.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well it usually works to a limited extent.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is like running away from my agony by going to football; I come back home, it is there! I don't want to go to watch football but I want to see what violence is and to see if it is possible to be completely free of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>If I am in a very unpleasant society and I can escape from it by defecting, or leaving it and going to another one. And this does in fact mean I escape to some extent.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So these are always partial answers and they are partially effective.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't want to be partially violent. Or partially free from it. I want to find out if it is possible to totally end it. That's not an escape, that's putting my teeth into it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes. But you have to believe it is possible in order to put your teeth into it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't know, I am going to investigate. I said for me, I know one can live without violence. But that may be a freak, that may be a biological freak and so on. But to discuss together, the four of us, and see if we could be free of violence completely means not escaping, not suppressing, not transcending it, and see what is violence. Violence is part of imitation, conformity. Right? Apart from physical hurts, I am not talking about that. So psychologically there is this constant comparing, that is part of hurt, part of violence. So can I live without comparison, when from childhood I have been trained to compare myself with somebody? I am talking comparison, not good cloth and bad cloth.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Talking about comparing myself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Myself, with you who are bright, who are clever, who have got publicity, when you say a word the whole world listens. And I can shout, nobody cares. So I want to be like you. So I am comparing constantly myself with something I think is greater.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>So this is where becoming comes from, comparing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's just it. So can I live without comparison?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Doesn't that leave me in an insufficient state?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. To live without comparison? No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Here I start of insufficient...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Am I dull because I compare myself with you who are bright?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, you are dull because you compare yourself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>By comparing myself with you who are bright, who are clever, I become dull, I think I am dull. But if I don't compare I am what I am.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well you may not compare but I may compare. I may say, you are dull.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. I say, all right. You say I am dull, I want to know what does it mean. Does it mean he is comparing himself with me who is - you follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Very frustrating, that. I mean if one compared oneself with somebody and said, "You are dull", and then they said, "What does dullness mean?"!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The other day, after one of the talks in England, a man came up to me and said, "Sir, you are a beautiful old man but you are stuck in a rut". I said, "Well, sir, perhaps, I don't know, we'll go into it". So I went up to my room and said, "Am I?", because I don't want to be stuck in a rut. I may be. So I went into it very, very carefully, step by step, and found what does a rut mean, to stick in a groove along a particular line. Maybe, so I watch it. So observation of a fact is entirely different from escaping or the suppression of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>So he says you are stuck in a rut, then you observe it, you don't compare it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't. Am I in a rut, I look. I may be stuck in a rut because I speak English. I speak Italian and French. All right. Am I psychologically, inwardly, caught in a groove, like a tram car?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Motivated by something and not understanding it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, am I, I don't know, I am going to find out. I am going to watch. I am going to be terribly attentive, sensitive, alert.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Now this requires that you don't react in the first place by saying, "No, that's horrible, I couldn"t possibly be stuck in a rut.'</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wouldn't. You may be telling the truth.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>To not have that reaction you can't have that self there that says, I am not the type of person that is stuck in ruts.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't know. Sir, is there a learning about oneself which is not - this leads to something else - which is not constant accumulation about myself? I don't know if I am making myself clear. I observe myself. And I have learnt from that observation something. And that something is being accumulated all the time by watching. I think that is not learning about yourself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Being concerned with what you think about yourself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, what you I think about yourself, what you have gathered about yourself. Like a river that is flowing, you have to follow it. That leads somewhere else. Let's get back.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Maybe this is part of the question we are asking because we started with how does this disorder occur.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, sir, let's stick to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It occurs because I have the image of myself of someone who knows he is not stuck in a rut, I don't like to think that I am stuck in a rut, and somebody says, yes you,you.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But you may be.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes. I have to be open to looking, to see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To observe.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But then what about this approach: somebody says I am stuck in a rut, I look at myself and think, yes, I am stuck in a rut; then I can respond by thinking, well, what's wrong with that, being stuck in a rut?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, that's just blind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>No, you accept the fact, but then you think, well, why should I do anything about it? What's wrong with that as an approach?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Like a man stuck as a Hindu, he is stuck. He is then contributing to war.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, I may say, well I am stuck in a rut, but so is everybody, it is the nature of humanity to be stuck in ruts.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, you go off, that is the nature of humanity. But I question that. If you say that is the nature of humanity, let's change it, for god's sake.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But you may believe it is unchangeable. What reason have I for believing that we can change it? I may be stuck in a rut, so are you, so is everybody else, anyone who thinks they are not is deceiving themselves.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Cheating themselves. So I begin to enquire, am I cheating myself? I want to be very honest about it. I don't what to cheat, I don't want to be a hypocrite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>You may not be a hypocrite, you may think I am stuck in a rut, and you may be a pessimist. The alternative to being a hypocrite is a pessimist.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I am neither a pessimist or an optimist. I say, look, am I stuck in a rut? I watch all day.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>And you perhaps conclude yes. But then you can take the pessimistic cause and say, yes, I am, but so what?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If you prefer that way of living, go ahead. But I don't want to live that way.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well the person who comes into therapy usually comes in with both sides going on at the same time. He says that, I have this problem which I want to be free of, I don't want to be stuck in a rut; on the other hand when it gets down to really looking at that he doesn't want to look at it either because it becomes uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, of course. To come back to your original question: the world is in disorder, human beings are in disorder, and we described what is disorder. And is there a possibility to live free from disorder? That is the real basic question. We said as long as there is this divisive process of life, I am a Hindu, you are an Arab, I am a Buddhist, You are a Muslim, I am British you are an Argentine, there must be conflict, war. My son is going to be killed, for what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>For as long as I identify on a personal level with my job, or with my family and so on, there will be pain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It is the same process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So is it possible to have without identification responsibility?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>If I am not identified will I even go to work?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But I am responsible for the lady whom I have married. Responsible in the sense that I have to look after her, care for her, and she has to care for me. Responsibility means order. But we have become totally irresponsible by isolating ourselves - British, French.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>We handle the problem of responsibility by developing a rut that we can work in.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That's it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And staying inside that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If I see the fact that responsibility is order, I am responsible to keep this house clean, but as we all live on this earth it is our earth, not the British earth, or French earth and German earth, it is our earth to live on. And we have divided ourselves because in this division we think there is security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>There is stability and security.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Security. Which is no security at all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well it isn't clear, we have got to go slowly because I think that my job is security, I think that my family is security.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You may lose it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That problem keeps coming up.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is great unemployment in America and in England - three million people unemployed in England.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well maybe I could get by without my job, but I need to think that I have some self respect.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What do you mean, self respect?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>What I am trying to say is that there is some place at which I put an identification.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why should I want to identify with anything, sir? That makes immediate isolation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>For stability's sake.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Does isolation bring about stability?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It gives one a sense of something hard and firm.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Does it? Has it? There have been during the last five thousand years nearly five thousands wars. Is that stability?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why don't we accept - well, I won't go into all that. What is wrong with us?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, why don't we see this thing? You are saying that the root of the problem is that I continue to identify with one thing after another, if one doesn't work I just find something else. I don't stop identifying.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, sir, which breeds isolation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>But in your example about a person that is stuck in a rut, you say I don't have to identify, I can just step back and look at this thing and see if it is true.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>So you are suggesting that there is something that is not identified, something that is free to look.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. This leads to something else. Why do I want to identify myself? Probably basically the desire to be secure, to be safe, to be protected. And that sense, it gives me strength.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes. Strength, and purpose, direction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It gives me strength.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But this is a biological fact. It is not merely an illusion. We again, to come back to the animal kingdom, we see it there: deer go round in flocks, birds have flocks, bees have hives and they are identified with the hive in which they work.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But bees don't kill themselves, species don't kill themselves.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well they kill other bees that invade their hide. They don't commit suicide. They kill others.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But we are?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes and no, bees do fight other bees that come into the hive.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I know that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So we see even in the animal kingdom this identification with the group, in the social animals, but many social animals, and we are social animals...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Just a minute. Agree. Are we by identifying ourselves with India, or China, or Germany, is that giving us security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>To a limited extent it is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A limited extent.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>And by identifying ourselves with our families does because this whole question of responsibility seems closely linked to it. If I identify myself with my family, feel duties, and so on, towards them, protect my sisters, I rush to her defence and make a big fuss about it and threaten, if not actually kill the people who insulted her.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have no sisters.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So if I protect members of my family, defend, rush to their defence, so an insult to them, or an attack, is an insult to me, so I rush to their defence...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...there is a reciprocal obligation on their part, if I fall ill or sick they'll feed me and look after me; if I get arrested by the police they will try and get me out of prison and so on. So it does give me a kind of security, it actually works.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>And that is a very good reason for doing it, for most people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Stretch it further from the family, to the community, from the community to the nation and so on, that is a vast process of isolating. You are English, I am German, and we are at each other's throat. And I say, for god's sake this is so damn stupid.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well it is not entirely stupid because it works to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It may work, but it is impractical, it is killing each other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>We haven't killed each other yet, there are more human beings than there have ever been before. So the system so far has gone to the point where far from killing each other we have actually got to the point where we have got a bigger population than the world has ever seen. So the system works only too well, for some reason.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So you propose war to kill them off?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>No! But there is some aspect of it that does work, and some security that is genuine that these things confer.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, sir. At a certain level identification has a certain importance. But at a higher level, if you can call it higher, it becomes dangerous. That's all we are saying. Of course if you are my brother you look after me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well it is very hard to draw up a line, you see that starts spreading out.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right, spreading out.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You know, it slips.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's is what I am so objecting to.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But you see the question is where do you draw the line because if you are my brother then you have the tribal, the clan, or in India, the caste.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's it. Extend it. And then we say, I am Argentine, you are British, he's French and we are economically, and socially, we are murdering each other. And I say that is so insane.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But where do you draw the line, you see. If you say the nation state is wrong, then what is wrong with the tribe, or the caste, then you have got conflict between those.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wouldn't draw the line. I say I am responsible as a human being for what is happening in the world, because I am a human. And so what is happening in the world is this terrible division, and I won't be a Hindu, I won't be a Catholic, Protestant, nothing. A hundred, or a thousand people like that, would begin to do something.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>So you are saying that the problem comes up because I mistake my local security, I think that it rests in some local identification.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which is isolation. And therefore in isolation there is no security. And therefore there is no order.</p>
<p class="right">Ojai 2nd Conversation with Bohm, Hidley and Sheldrake</p>
<p class="right">17th April 1982</p>


<h1>3. The Need for Security</h1>
<p><span class="tbold">TOM KRAUSE: </span>This is one of a series of dialogues between J Krishnamurti, David Bohm, Rupert Sheldrake and John Hidley. The purpose of these discussions is to explore essential questions about the mind. What is psychological disorder, and what is required for fundamental psychological change? J Krishnamurti is a religious philosopher, author and educator who has written and given lectures on these subjects for many years. He has founded elementary and secondary schools in the United States, England and India.</p>
<p>David Bohm is professor of theoretical physics at Birkbeck College, London University in England. He has written numerous books concerning theoretical physics and the nature of consciousness. Professor Bohm and Mr Krishnamurti have held previous dialogues on many subjects.</p>
<p>Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist whose recently published book proposes that learning in some members of a species affects the species as a whole. Dr Sheldrake is presently consulting plant physiologist to the International Crops Research Institute at Hyderabad, India.</p>
<p>John Hidley is a psychiatrist in private practice who has been associated with the Krishnamurti school at Ojai, California for the past six years.</p>
<p>In the first two dialogues consideration has been given to the process of self identification. A range of subjects has been related to this process, including the problem of suffering, the role of thinking and memory, images, and the uniqueness or commonality of consciousness. Can these processes be observed, and what is the relationship of observation to order, responsibility and change? Today's discussion focuses on the question: is there such a thing as absolute psychological security?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>We would like to talk about the question of whether there is a deep security, whether the self can be dissolved. You have suggested that if that's possible, then the problems that the individual brings to the office, the problems...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, why do we seek security, apart from physical? Apart from terrestrial security, why do we want security?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, we know moments of peace and happiness, and we want to stabilize that, hold that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then that becomes a memory.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not actual security. A memory that one day we were happy, and I wish we could go back to it. Or you project an idea and a hope someday to achieve it. But why is it that human beings, probably throughout the world, seek security? What is the raison d'etre, I mean, what is the demand for security? What makes people ask for security, psychologically?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, they're occupied, they're filled with their problems. There's the feeling that if I can solve the problem, if I can find out what the right answer is, if...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's not security, surely. There is great uncertainty, great sense of emptiness in oneself, loneliness. Really, loneliness - let's take that for an example.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I may be married, I may have children and all the rest of it but I still feel isolated, lonely. And it's frightening, depressing, and I realize it is isolating. After all, loneliness is the essence of isolation, in which I have no relationship with anybody. Is that one of the reasons why human beings seek this desire for security?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, to fill that up.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh much deeper than that. To be secure in my fulfillment, to be free of fear, free of my agony. I want to be free of all those so that I can be completely secure in peace and happiness. Is that what we want?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that the reason why we seek?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And we want that to be stable over time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Stable, permanent - if there is anything permanent - is that the reason why we crave this, demand, crave for security?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That means to be free from fear and then I am totally secure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It feels like I have to be that way in order to function adequately.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Function adequately comes later.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>What do you mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If I am secure, I function.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If I am very anchored in something which I think is false or true, I'll act according to those principles. But is it that human beings are incapable of solving this deep-rooted fear. For example I am taking fear - and they have not been able to solve it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, that's right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Psychological fears. And to be free from that is to be so marvellously secure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>You are saying that if we can solve these problems at a fundamental level.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Otherwise what's the point, how can I be totally secure?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, is it the physical security, of bread, of shelter, of food and clothes, spilling over to the psychological field? You understand what I mean?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Do you mean, is that where the psychological feeling of the need for security comes from?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, partly. One must have food and clothes and shelter. That's an absolute essential, otherwise you four wouldn't be sitting here. In the search of that, psychologically also I want to be equally secure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>They seem to be equated.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I'm questioning whether it is so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or, the psychological desire to be secure prevents physical security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It seems like the psychological desire to be secure arises out of the necessity to function in reality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want to be psychologically secure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So I am attached to a group, a community, a nation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which then prevents me from being secure. Security means long-lasting security. But if I identify myself in my search for psychological security and attach myself to a nation, that very isolation is going to destroy me. So why do we seek this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay, then you're saying that there is a mistake, which is that we identify ourselves, attach ourselves to something and seek security in that, and that that's fundamentally wrong.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, no, not fundamental. I won't say right or wrong.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am asking why? Why do human beings do this? A fact which is right through the world, it's not just for a certain community, all human beings want to be so unshakably security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I think people have some answer. You see, if you say there's a young child, or a baby, he feels the need to be loved by his parents and it seems that at a certain stage the infant has the need for a kind of psychological security, which he should grow out of perhaps, but since he isn't properly taken care of by his parent very often, he begins to feel lost, as you say, alone, isolated, and there arises a demand that he become inwardly secure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A baby must be secure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, psychologically as well as physically, would you say.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, there must be.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now at some stage you would say that it would change.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I don't know what age.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why. At a certain age, a small baby or a young child, it must be protected.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In every way, psychologically...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Psychologically...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...it must not be shocked psychologically.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...you protect it with affection, taking it in your lap, cuddling him or her, and holding his hand, you make him feel that he is loved, that he is cared for. That gives him a feeling, here is somebody who is looking after me, and there is security here.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and then I suppose he will grow up not requiring that security.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's it. I am questioning, as he grows up, and as he faces the world, why does he crave for security?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I think very few children ever have that love to begin with, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, that's it. So is that the problem?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I don't know, but that's one factor.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That we really don't love? And if one loves, there is no need for security. You don't even think about security. If I love you... not intellectually, not because you give me comfort, sex, or this or that - I really have this deep sense of love for another. What is the need for security? It's my responsibility to see that you are secure. But you don't demand it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But human beings do. And does that mean we don't love another?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, it means that what we love is the...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I love you because you give me something.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes. You make me feel like I'm going to get that security which I crave.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, we are skirting around this. Why? Why do I want security so that I feel completely content, without fear, without anxiety, without agony and so on? Is fear the root of all this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>We seem to have mentioned already several things that are the root of it? As the baby grows up and isn't loved, he feels the need for that, he remembers that, he tries to return to that or get that as an adult, he's afraid because he's not protected, and as an adult he tries to get that protection.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or, sir, is it unconsciously we know that the self, the me, the ego, is really totally unstable.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>You are saying that in its nature it's totally unstable?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In its nature unstable. And therefore there is this anxiety for security outside and inside.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Why do you say it's totally unstable?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Isn't it? Isn't our consciousness unstable?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It seems to have two sides to it. One side says that if I could just get such and such, I would be stable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And there is a contradiction in that. I may not be.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I may not be.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I'm not yet, but I will be.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Will be.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, much more fundamentally, is not this the self itself in a state of movement, uncertainty, attached; fear in attachment; all that? That's state of lack of stability. Therefore I am asking, is that the reason that human beings unconsciously knowing the instability of the self, want security, God, the saviour?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Wanting something absolute?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that'll give complete contentment. Our consciousness is its content. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And the content is always in contradiction. I believe...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That's right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...and yet I'm frightened of not believing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That's why you're saying in essence it's unstable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously it is unstable. So clearly unstable. I want this thing and some other desire comes along and says, don't have that, for God's sake; there is this contradiction, this duality, all that exists in our consciousness: fear, pleasure, fear of death, you know all the content of our consciousness, all that. So that is unstable.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Now sensing all of that, people generally say this problem is too deep or too complex, there's no way to solve it, we can maybe just make some adjustments.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, yes. And in that adjustment also there is lack of stability. So unconsciously there must be craving for security. So we invent God.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>We keep inventing lots of different things we hope will give us that security.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We create God, he's our creation. We are not the creation of God, I wish we were. We would be totally different. So there is this illusory desire for security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Now wait a minute, why do you say that it's illusory?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because they invent something in which they hope they'll be secure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Oh, I see. Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, if the content of our consciousness can be changed... quotes, changed - would there be need for security?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>If we could eliminate all these contradictions?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, contradictions.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Then maybe we would have the security because our consciousness would be stable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So that maybe it. We may not call it security. To be secure, which is a really disgusting desire, sorry. To be secure in what? About what? Personally I never thought about security. You might say, well, you are looked after, you are cared for by others and all the rest of it, therefore there is no need for you to think about security, but I never - I don't want security. I need, of course, I need food, clothes and shelter, that's understood, somebody to...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>We're talking about psychological security.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I'm talking much deeper issue.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And you're saying that that occurs because the contents of consciousness are no longer contradictory.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It may not be what we know as consciousness, it may be something totally different. All that we know is fear, reward and pleasure, and death and constant conflict in relationship: I love you but...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Within limits.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Within limits. I don't know if that's called love. So there is the content of consciousness is all that; which is me. My consciousness is me. In this complex contradictory dualistic existence the very fact creates the demand for security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So can we eliminate the self?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, have we got to the self? It seems like there's somebody in there, in here, who's going to juggle all these things and get rid of the contradictions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But that means you are different from this; from consciousness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But you are that! You are pleasure, you are fear, you are belief, all that you are. Don't please agree with what we are talking about, what I'm saying. It may be all tommyrot.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I think there are a lot of people who wouldn't agree with that. I think that they would say that...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know there're a lot of people wouldn't because they haven't gone into it. They just want to brush all this aside.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, let's look at this. Is there a self that separate, that's going to be able to somehow iron out these contradictions?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>How do you know? I mean it seems to me that there is - well, at least it may be illusory, but it's very easy to think that one is separate from some of these problems and that there's something inside one which can make decisions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Doctor, am I separate from my fear? Am I separate from the agony I go through? The depression?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, I think that there's something within one which can examine these things and that's how it indicates there is some kind of separation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because there is the observer separate from the observed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that so?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, it seems to be so.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It seems to be so!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Now, this seems to be the problem, that it does seem to be so, I mean, in my own experience, of course, and many other people's it does indeed seem that there is an observer observing things like fear and one's own reactions. And it comes out most clearly, I find, in insomnia, if one's trying to sleep there's one part of one that going on with silly worries and ridiculous thoughts round and round; there's another part of one that says, I really want to sleep, I wish I could stop all these silly thoughts. And there one has this actual experience of an apparent separation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So this isn't just a theory, it's an actual fact of experience that there is this kind of separation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I agree, I agree. But why does that division exist? Who created the division?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>It may just be a fact.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What may?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>It may just be a fact.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that so? I want to examine it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, so do I. I mean, is it indeed a fact that consciousness, as it were, has levels, some of which can examine others, one at a time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Would you kindly consider, is fear different from me? I may act upon fear, I may say, I must suppress it, I may rationalize it, I might transcend it, but the fear is me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, we often...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You only invent the separation where you want to act upon it. But otherwise I am fear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>The common and ordinary way of analyzing it would be to say, I feel afraid, as if the afraidness was separate from the I. I want to get out of this state of feeling afraid, so I want to escape from it, leaving the fear behind and the I will pass beyond it and somehow escape it. This is the normal way we think.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So what's wrong with that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You keep up this conflict.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I think he is saying it may be inevitable.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>It may be inevitable, you see...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I question it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, well, then how do you propose to show it's not inevitable?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First of all, when there is anger, at the moment of anger, there is no separation. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>When you're very angry...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...what we normally say is you lose control of yourself and the separation disappears, you become the anger, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>At the moment when you are really angry, there is no separation. The separation only takes place after. "I have been angry." Right? Now, why? Why does this separation take place?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Through memory.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Through memory, right. Because I have been angry before. So the past is evaluating, the past recognizing. So the past is the observer.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That may not be obvious, you know. For example, I may have physical reactions that go out of control, like sometimes the hand or the body, and then I say I am observing those physical reactions going out of control and I would like to bring them back in, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think somebody might feel the same way, that his mental reactions are going out of control and that they have momentarily escaped his control and that he's trying to bring them back in. You see, now, that's the way it may look or feel to many people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, then it is not clear. Have we made it clear that that is not the case, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, I am trying to point out, I don't know if I am making myself clear: when one is frightened, actually, there's no me separate from fear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>But then there seems...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>When there is a time interval, there is the division. And time interval, time is thought. And when thought comes in then begins the division. Because thought is memory; the past.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Thought involves memory - yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, involves memory and so on. So thought, memory, knowledge, is the past. So the past is the observer; who says I am different from fear, I must control it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Let's go through this very slowly because it's seems like the experience is that the observer is the present. It seems like he's saying, I'm here now and what am I going to do about this the next time it comes up.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But the 'what am I going to do about it' is the response of the past, because you have already had that kind of experience. Sir, haven't you had fear?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Surely.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You know, something, a fear that has really shaken you.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Devastating one.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And at that second there is no division, you are entirely consumed by that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now, then thought comes along and says, I've been afraid or because of this and because of that, now I must defend myself, rationalize fear and so on, so on, so on. It's so obvious, what are we discussing?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, I think that, coming back again to the physical reaction which can also consume you and you say at the next moment, you say, I didn't notice it at the time, thought comes in and says, that's a physical reaction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now I know it, you see, what is the difference of these two cases, you see, that in the second case it would make sense to say, I know that I have reacted this way before, right? You know, I can take such an such an action.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't quite follow this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Somebody can feel that, it's true I get overwhelmed by a reaction and thought comes in. But in many areas that's a normal procedure for thought to come in if something shattering happens, and then a moment later, you think, what was it? Right? Now, in some cases that would be correct, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now, why is it in this case it is not, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, I see what you mean. You answer it. You see, you meet a rattler on a walk.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which I have done very often. You meet a rattler, he rattles and you jump. That is, physical self-protective intelligent response. That's not fear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right. Well, not psychological fear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It has been called a kind of fear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know, I don't call that psychological fear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, it's not psychological fear, it's a simple physical reaction...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Physical reaction...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...of danger.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...which is an intelligent reaction not to be bitten by the rattler.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but a moment later I can say, I know that's rattler or it's not a rattler, I may discover it's not a rattler, it's another snake which is not so dangerous.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, not so dangerous, then I pass it by.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But then thought comes in and it's perfectly all right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes,</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But here, when I am angry or frightened...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then thought comes in.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And it's not all right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It's not all right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, I see what you are trying to get at. Why do I say it is not all right. Because fear is devastating, it blocks one's mind and thought and all the rest of it, one shrinks in that fear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I think I see that. You mean that possibly that when thought comes in it cannot possibly come in rationally in the midst of fear, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Is that what you mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what I'm trying to say.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So in the case of physical danger, it would still come in rationally.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Here it becomes irrational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why, I am asking, why? Why doesn't one clear up this awful mess?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, it isn't clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Look, sir, it is a messy consciousness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, it's a messy consciousness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Messy consciousness, contradicting.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Frightened, oh, so many fears and so on, it's a messy consciousness. Now, why can't we clear it up?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, it seems we are always trying to clear it up after the fact.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think the difficulty lies in that we don't recognize deeply this this messy consciousness is me. And if it is me, I can't do anything! I don't know if you get the point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>You mean we think that there's a me separate from this messy consciousness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We think we are separate. And therefore we are accustomed, it is our conditioning, to act upon it. But I can't very well do that with all this messy consciousness which is me. So the problem then arises, what is action? We are accustomed to act upon the messy consciousness. When there is realization of the fact that I can't act, because I am that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Then what is action?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is non-action.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, that's not okay, that is the total difference.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, I think I understand. On the one hand there's the action of consciousness on itself which just perpetuates things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And seeing that, then it ceases to act.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It's not non-violence.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Sorry sir, you're saying that normally we have the idea that there's a self which is somehow separate from some of the contents of our consciousness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right, that's right, sir.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>If someone tells us we're wonderful, we don't want to be separate from that, but if we feel afraid and if somebody tells we're awful, we do want to be separate from that. So it's rather selective. But nevertheless we do feel there's something in us which is separate from the contents of this messy consciousness. We normally act in such a way as to change either the contents of the consciousness or our relation to the world, and so on. But we don't normally examine this apparent separation between the self, the me, and the contents of the messy consciousness. That's something we don't challenge. Now you're suggesting that in fact this separation which we can actually experience and do, most of us do experience, is in fact something we ought to challenge and look at and we ought to face the idea that we actually are the messy consciousness and nothing other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. It's so obvious.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, it isn't obvious, it's very non-obvious and it's a very difficult thing to realize, because one's very much in the habit of thinking one is separate from it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So can we move away from our conditioning? Our conditioning is me. And then I act upon that conditioning, separating myself. But if I am that, no action, which is the most positive action.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>The way that that would be heard, I'm afraid, is that if I don't act on it it's just going to stay the way it is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>You're suggesting that by recognizing this, the process of recognizing it, facing up to...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It's not facing up. Who is to face up? Not recognize. Who is to recognize it? You see, we always think in those terms. I am that, full stop. We never come to that realization, totally. There is some part of me which is clear and that clarity is going to act upon that which is not clear. Always this goes on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am saying the whole content of one's consciousness is unclear, messy. There is no part of it that's clear. We think there is a part, which is the observer, separating himself from the mess. So the observer is the observed. Gurus, and all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You were raising the question of action, though; if that is the case, how is action to take place?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>When there is perception of that which is true, that very truth is sufficient, it is finished.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You have said also, for example, that that-ness itself realizes its own messiness, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Messiness, it's finished.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Sir, are you suggesting that the realization of the messiness itself in some way dissolves the messiness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Not a separative realization that I am messy. The fact is consciousness is messy, full stop. And I can't act upon it. Because previously acting upon it was a wastage of energy. Because I never solved it. I have struggled, I have taken vows, I have done all kinds of things to resolve this messy stuff. And it has never been cleared. It may partially occasionally...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, I think that's another aspect of this. In therapy or in our own lives we seem to have insights that are partial, that we clear up a particular problem and gain some clarity and order for a time. And then the thing returns in some other form or...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>...the same form. You're suggesting that the thing needs to be done across the board in some way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Before the observer acts upon it, upon the messy consciousness, right? Say, I'll clear this up, give it time, you know all the rest of it. But that's a wastage of energy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>When the fact that you are that - you are not wasting energy. Which is attention. I don't know if you want to go into this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>No, this is very interesting. Please do.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would we agree that acting upon it is a wastage of energy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes. This creates more disorder.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. It creates much disorder, and there is this constant conflict between me and the not me. The me who is the observer and I battle with it, control it, suppress it, anxious, worry, you follow? Which is all essentially wastage of energy. Whereas this messy consciousness is me. I have come to realize that through attention. Not I have come to - sorry.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Would you say that the consciousness itself has come to realize it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I mean, it's not me, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Which is total attention I am giving to this consciousness - not I am - there is attention and inattention. Inattention is wastage of energy. Attention is energy. When there is observation that consciousness is messy, that fact can only exist when there is total attention. And when there is total attention, it doesn't exist any more, confusion. It's only inattention that creates the problems. Refute it!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But, sir, I don't understand entirely what you're saying. This total attention that you're talking about would only be able to have this effect if it somehow was something completely in the present and devoid of memory.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course, attention is that. If I attend to what you have said just now, devoid of memory, which is attention, I listen to you not only with the sensual ear, but with the other ear, which is, I am giving my whole attention to find out what you are saying; which is actually in the present. In attention there is no centre.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Because the attention and the thing attended to become one, you mean. You mean there's no centre in the attention because the attention is all there is, the thing attended to and the attention is all there is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, no, no. There is messiness because I have been inattentive. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>When there is the observation of the fact that the observer is the observed, and that state of observation in which there is no observer as the past, that is attention.</p>
<p>Sir, I don't know if you have gone into the question of meditation here. That's another subject.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That may be a relevant subject. It seems that what you're talking about may happen partially.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah! It can't happen, then you keep partial mess and partial not mess. We're back again the same position.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But do you think this kind of attention you're talking about is the sort of thing that many people experience occasionally in moments of great beauty, or occasionally a piece of music they're really enjoying, they lose themselves, and so on - do you think that many of us have had glimpses of this in these kinds of experiences?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's it. That's it. When I see a mountain, the majesty and the dignity and the depth of it drives away myself. A child with a toy, the toy absorbs him. The mountain has absorbed me; toy has absorbed the child. I say that means there is something outside which will absorb me, which will make me peaceful. Which means an outside agency that'll keep me quiet: God, prayer, looking up to something or other. If I reject an outside agency completely, nothing can absorb me. Let's say, if you absorb me, when you are gone I am back to myself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So I discard any sense of external agency which will absorb me. So I am left with myself, that's my point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I see. So you're suggesting that when this happens partially it's because we're depending on something.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It's like my depending on my wife.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Or my therapist or my problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Something or other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Like a Hindu, Catholic or anybody, they depend on something. Therefore dependence demands attachment.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Now it's possible to listen to you say this and have the idea of what you are talking about and try and do that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, you can't do it! That means you are acting again. You want something out of it. In exchange I'll give you this, you give me that. Just a trade. Here it's not like that, you are enquiring into something which demands a great deal of thought, great deal of intelligence and attention. I say, look, why is there this division, this mess in the world? Because our consciousness is messy and so the world is messy. So from that arises, is it possible to be free of the self? Consciousness, the messy consciousness, is the self.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>It is not possible to be free from the contents of consciousness, different experiences, as long as my eyes are open, I'm looking, I see all sorts of different things. Now what you were saying about the attention when one's looking at a mountain, for example, are you suggesting that if I have that same kind of attention to everything I experience, that then this is the...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, again you experience.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, well, all right, but...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You are the experience.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Right. That means, there is no experience.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>There's just attention, you mean.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Experience involves remembrance. Time, which is the past. Therefore the experiencer is the experienced. If I seek illumination, enlightenment, or whatever you might call it, I am then trying to do all kinds of things to achieve that. But I don't know what illumination is. I don't know. Not because you said it or Buddha said it or somebody has said it: I don't know. But I am going to find out. Which means the mind must be totally free: from prejudice, from fear, all the rest of that messy business. So my concern is not illumination, but whether the content of my consciousness can be cleansed - whatever word you use. That's my concern - not concern, that's my enquiry. And as long as I am separate from my consciousness, I can experience it, I can analyze it, I can tear it to pieces, act upon it - which means perpetual conflict with me and my consciousness. I wonder why we accept all this. Why do I accept that I am a Hindu? Why do I accept I am a Catholic? You follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why do we accept what other people say?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, we say it ourselves.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. No, not only we say it but it's encouraged, sustained, nourished by people outside. Why? Why do we accept it? He is a professor and he is teaching me, I accept that. Because he knows biology much more than I do, I go to his class, and I am being informed by what he says. But he's not my guru, he's not my behaviour guide. He is giving me information about biology and I am interested in it. I want to study it, I want to go out into the field and do all kinds of stuff. But why do we accept authority, psychological authority, spiritual - quote spiritual - authority? Again we come back to security. I don't know what to do but you know better than I do; you are my guru. I refuse that position.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But don't we arrive at the same set of problems if we start not from authority but from responsibility; say I'm the father, I have this child - we've agreed some time ago...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You have to instruct it, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>You have to look after this baby.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Fine. But now in order to feed the baby you become preoccupied with security: job tenure, you know, house...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...protecting the house against marauders and so on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Don't you get into the same lot of things about preoccupation with security starting not from authority but from responsibility for others, for children, for example.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>So then what is the answer to that. It's easy to say you should reject responsibility.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, I have money, if I earn money, job, so on, I have to look after myself, I have servants, I have to look after servants, my children, perhaps their children too. I am responsible for all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Physically I am responsible. To give them food, to give the right amount of money, allow their children go to a proper school like my children, I am responsible for all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But isn't that going to bring you back to the same position of insecurity and so on that you were trying to dissolve by this rejection of authority?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't see why I need spiritual or psychological authority. Because if I know how to read myself, I don't need anybody to tell me. But we have never attempted deeply to read the book of myself. I come to you and say, please, help me to read. And then the whole thing is lost.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>But I think what Rupert is asking is that if we start by assuming responsibility for other people, that entails...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What? My earning capacity.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Which must be secure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, secure as much as possible. Not in countries where there's tremendous unemployment.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>So you're saying that that doesn't entail any psychological insecurity.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course not. But when I say, he's my servant, I'm going to keep him in that place, you follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No. Tell me more.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I mean, I treat him as a servant.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which becomes irresponsible. Naturally.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>But if it's a servant, he can come and go. But if it's a child...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>...he can't come and go.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He's part of my family.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think the question is something like this, that suppose you are responsible for a family and the conditions are difficult, you may not have a job and you may start to worry about it and become insecure psychologically.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't worry about it, there it is, I have no more money. So, my friend, I have no more money, if you want to stay, share the little food I have, we'll share it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You're saying that even if you are unemployed and you are responsible for a family it will not disturb the order of the mind, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You will find an intelligent way to solve it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Deal with it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But this kind of worry as a result of responsibility is relative.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't call it worry. I am responsible.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And therefore I look after as much as I can.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>What if you can't?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You can't. Why should I worry and bother, I can't, it's a fact.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You're saying that it's possible to be completely free of worry, for example, in the face of great difficulties.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, that's what I am saying. Where there is attention, there is no worry, because there is no centre from which you are attending.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>There are still problems and there may still be responsibilities that one has.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course I have problems, so I resolve them.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But if you can't resolve them.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then I can't.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>If your family is starving.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I can't. Why should I worry about it? I can't be Queen of England.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>No.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But if you're a poor Indian, unemployed, your family is starving, there's nothing, you've tried everything, you've failed. And you don't worry. Actually, surprisingly enough, a lot of poor Indians in just that situation don't worry, that's the most amazing thing about India. But then of course people coming along looking from outside say, well, this is fatalism.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that's right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>And it's often regarded as the disease of India, the very fact that so many people manage not to worry in those circumstances... to the degree that we would expect.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I'd like to ask you a question. You've listened to all this: messy consciousness - does one realize it, and empty the content: fear, you know, the whole business? Does it interest you?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Totally?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That means what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It means you just listen.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it means a conversation, dialogue between us. Penetrating deeper and deeper and deeper. Which means you must be free to examine. Free from your prejudice, from your previous experience. Of course, otherwise you can't examine. You can't investigate... 'investigate' means explore, you know, push, push, push it further and further. Now, are you, are we willing to do that, so that actually the self is not? But when the self is not it doesn't mean you neglect your wife, your children - you follow? It becomes so silly, like becoming a sannyasi, going off to the mountains, a monk going off into a monastery. That's an extraordinary escape. The fact is I have to deal with my wife and children and if I have a servant. Can I be so totally without the self that I can intelligently deal with these problems? </p>

<p class="right">17th April 1982</p>


<h1>4. What Is a Healthy Mind?</h1>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't capture the depth of your meaning, what is implied. You have gone into it and you can say that, absolute attention. I hear it and make it into an idea. And then I pursue the idea.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That seems to be the process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what we do all the time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So it's gone. Idea is not what you said. What you said had depth in it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>But we don't know that we're pursuing an idea.</p>
<p><span class="tbold">TOM KRAUSE: </span>This is one of a series of dialogues between J Krishnamurti, David Bohm, Rupert Sheldrake and John Hidley. The purpose of these discussions is to explore essential questions about the mind: what is psychological disorder and what is required for fundamental psychological change?</p>
<p>J Krishnamurti is a religious philosopher, author and educator who has written and given lectures on these subjects for many years. He has founded elementary and secondary schools in the United States, England and India. David Bohm is professor of theoretical physics at Birkbeck College, London University in England. He has written numerous books concerning theoretical physics and the nature of consciousness. Professor Bohm and Mr Krishnamurti have held previous dialogues on many subjects.</p>
<p>Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist whose recently published book proposes that learning in some members of a species affects the species as a whole. Dr Sheldrake is presently consulting plant physiologist to the International Crops Research Institute in Hyderabad, India.</p>
<p>John Hidley is a psychiatrist in private practice who has been associated with the Krishnamurti school in Ojai, California for the past six years.</p>
<p>The first three dialogues have focused on various processes of self-identification, and their effects. The need for psychological security has been discussed as growing out of a basic division in which the contents of consciousness appear to be separate from consciousness itself. Today's discussion begins with the importance of attention.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is analysis? And what is observation? In analysis there is the analyzer and the analyzed. And so there is always that difference maintained. Where there is difference there must be conflict, division, and that's one of the factors that really is very destructive to the whole psychological freedom: this conflict, this division. And analysis maintain this division. Whereas if one observes closely - I'm not correcting you, sir, I'm just enquiring... the analyzer is the analyzed. Again the same problem, thought has divided the analyzer and the analyzed. The analyzer is the past who has acquired a lot of knowledge, information, separated himself, and is either correcting the observed, the analyzed: make him conform, he is acting upon it. Whereas the analyzer is the analyzed. I think if that is really understood very deeply, the psychological conflict ends, because in that there is no division between the analyzer and the analyzed, there is only observation. Which Dr Bohm and we discussed at considerable length last year.</p>
<p>So if that is clearly understood - I am not laying down the law, but as one has observed this whole business of conflict - whether one can live the whole of one's life without conflict. That means the controller is absent; which is a very dangerous question. I feel where there is inattention, lack of attention, is the really the whole process of conflict.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, I can see that if both sides saw this with the utmost clarity...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That means they are giving intelligence to the whole problem.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>What happens if only one party in a conflict sees it with that utmost clarity?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What happens? One gives complete attention in one's relationship between man and woman; let's begin with that. You have given complete attention. When she insults you, when she flatters you, when she bullies you or when she is attached to you, all that is the lack of attention. If you give complete attention and the wife doesn't, then what happens? That is the same problem. Either you try to explain day after day, go into it with her patiently. After all, attention implies also great deal of care, affection, love. It's not just mental attention. It's attention with all your being. Then either she moves along with you, comes over to your side, as it were, or she holds on to her separative contradictory state. Then what happens? One is stupid, the other is intelligent.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But the conflict...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So there is always the battle between the stupid and the ignorant. I mean between the ignorant, the stupid and the intelligent.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>A thing that seems to happen in that situation is that the one's intelligence makes room in which the other person who is caught in some attachment may have freedom to look.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But if the other refuses to look at it, then what is the relationship between the two people?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>There is none.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's all. You see tribalism is deadly, destructive. You see it basically, fundamentally, and I don't. You have seen it probably immediately and I'll take many years, a long time to come to that. Will you have the - I won't use the word patience - will you have the care, affection, love, so that you understand my stupidity? I may rebel against you. I may divorce you. I may run away from you. But you have sown the seed somewhere in me. But that does happen, doesn't it, really, in life?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>You said something that interests me here, you said that if you have seen it immediately and the other person may take a long time to come to seeing it. And it seems like in this attention that you're talking about, perception is immediate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It isn't built up out of...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no, no, then it's not perception.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, that may be part of the reason the other person is having difficulty seeing it, is that they want it to be proved to them.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see conditioning...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...is destructive. And I don't.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is our relationship between us two? It's very difficult to communicate with each other...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...verbally or with care, it's very difficult.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>You won't know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And also I'm resisting you all the time. I'm defending myself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>You're defending what you think you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What I think is right. I have been brought up as a Hindu or a British or a German or a Russian, whatever it is, and I like it. And I see the danger of letting that go. I might lose my job. People will say I'm little-minded. People might say I depend on public opinion, so I'm frightened to let go. So I stick to it. Then what is your relationship with me? Have you any relationship?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I question whether you have no relationship.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I can tell you what I see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But if you have love for me, real, not just attachment, and sex and all that business, if you really care for me, you cannot lose that relationship. I may run away, but you have the feeling of relationship. I don't know if I am conveying what I mean.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>In other words, I don't just say, well, I see it and you don't, and if you're not going to listen, the heck with you.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Sir, you have established a kind of relationship, perhaps very profound, when there is love. I may reject you, but you have that responsibility of love. And not only to the particular person, but to the whole of humanity. What do you say, sir, about all this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I can't say. I think that this care and attention are the essential points. For example in the question of the observer and the observed or the analyzer and the analyzed, the reason why that separation occurs is because there has not been enough attention.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Attention, that's what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So that one has to have that same attitude even in looking at one's own psychological problems.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>An attitude of care?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Care and attention to what's going on, you see, one starts to analyze by habit, and one might condemn that, for example, that would not be the right attitude. But one has to give care and attention to exactly what is happening in that just as in relationship with people, right? And it's because that there was no attention or not the right kind of attention that that division arose in the first place, and was sustained, right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But it's possible to have perhaps this kind of attention towards people that we know: wives, children, friends, etcetera, but what about people we don't know? I mean, most of us have never met any Russians, for example, and we feel, many of us, there's this terrible fear of Russia and Russian nuclear weapons and the Russian threat and all the rest of it. And so it's very easy to think, well, we've got to have all these bombs and so on because the Russians are so terrible. We can think all these things about Russians, we've never met them. So how do we have attention to enemies or imagined enemies that we don't know?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is an enemy? Is there such thing as an enemy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, there are enemies in the sense that there are people who...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...who disagree with you...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...not only disagree.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...who have definite idealistic ideological differences.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, they're usually people who are afraid of us, I mean, the Russians are afraid of us and we're afraid of them. Because they're afraid of us they're in a position of being our enemies.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because we are still thinking in terms of tribalism.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, certainly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Supposing you and I move out of that. I'm Russian, you are English or British or German or French. I move, I despise this sense of tribalism. What's my relationship then with you?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, we...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I'm not Russian then.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>No.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I'm a human being with all my psychological problems and you are another human being with all your psychological problems. We are human beings, not labels.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Of course the Russians may reject this, you see, that is, suppose we're in this situation...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are in that...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...and the Russians will reject this, right. Then what's the next step, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what shall we do? You see, I represent all humanity. I am all humanity. I feel that way. To me it's an actuality, not just an emotional explosion, emotional, romantic idea. I feel I am the rest of mankind; I am mankind. Because I suffer or I enjoy, I go through all the tortures and so do you, so do you. So you are the rest of mankind. And therefore you have terrible responsibility in that. So when you meet a Russian or a German or a British or Argentine you treat them as human beings, not labels.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Then does this simply mean that in this largely tribal society with governments and bombs and weapons of war, there'll just be a few individual scattered here and there who've dissolved tribalism in themselves?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. If a hundred of us all over the world really had a non-tribalistic attitude towards life, we would be acting like a - I don't know - like a light in the midst of darkness. But we don't. This just becomes an idealistic romantic idea and you drop it because each pursues his own way.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, I think we ought to differentiate between attention and concentration. Concentration is focussing your energy on a certain point; and in attention, there is no focussing on a certain point. It's attention.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Concentration seems to have a goal in mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A goal, motive; it's a restrictive process. I concentrate on a page, but I am looking out of the window and I'll pull it back and keep on this business. Whereas if I give complete attention to what I am looking out of the window, that lizard which is going along the wall, and with that same attention I can look at my book, look what I am doing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Concentration presupposes that there's a controller in there pulling back.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But then, if there's no controller of the attention, the attention is simply a response to whatever the present circumstances are.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You insult me; I'm attentive. There is no recording that insult.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that's it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You flatter me: what a marvellous talk you gave the other day. I've heard this so often repeated. And I'm bored with it, so - I'm not only bored, I see - what? You follow, sir? Is it possible... really, that's the much more difficult question - is it possible not to record, except where it is necessary? It's necessary to record when you are driving. To learn how to drive. Record when you do your business and all the rest of it. But psychologically, what is the need to record?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Isn't it inevitable? Doesn't our memory work automatically?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Memory is rather selective.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>We seem to remember things that are important to us...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>...have some connection with who we think we are and what our goals are.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems to me that when there is paying attention then in general attention determines what is to be recorded and what is not, that is, it is not automatic any more.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It's not automatic any more. Quite right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If it comes from the past, from the concentration or from the analysis, then it will be automatic.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Another problem which we ought to discuss - we said yesterday we would - religion, meditation, and if there is something sacred. We said we would talk about that.</p>
<p>Is there anything sacred in life? Not thought creating something sacred, and then worshipping that sacred, which is absurd. The symbols in all the Indian temples, they're religious, like in the Christian church, or in the Muslim mosque there is this marvellous writing, which is the same. And we worship that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That's idolatry.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Thought has created this. The thought has created the image and then it worships it. I don't know if you see the absurdity of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, that's manifestly absurd, but the more sophisticated members of different religions would say that it's not the thought, the image created by thought that's being worshipped, but the image points to something beyond thought which is being worshipped.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait a minute, let's look at it. That is, the symbol, we know symbol is not the real, but why do we create the symbol? Please answer it. If there is something beyond, why do we create the intermediary?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, I think that this is a question which in certain religions has been central to them: the Jews, who were against all idolatry for exactly this reason, and the Muslims, who don't have images in the mosques.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No but they have these scripts.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>They have writing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But they think writing is what tells them about what lies beyond all symbols, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Now you could say the writing simply becomes a symbol, but I mean, these are words, and words can help us. We're having a discussion, and these words that we're having, your words may help me, for example. If they're written down, then they're written words like Muslim words.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So; why do I have to have an intermediary at all?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Because I think I'm here and it's over there and I don't have it. I need some way to get there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, you're not answering my question. Is it that you, the intermediary, understand or realized or follow truth or whatever it is, therefore you are telling me about it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, maybe I've seen something and I want to tell you about it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, tell me about it, but why do you make yourself interpreter? Why do you become the intermediary between that - I don't know what that is - and me, who is ignorant, who is suffering? Why don't you deal with my suffering rather than with that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>I think that that will deal with your suffering. If I can get you to...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That has been, sir, that has been the old trick of all the priests in the world. We have had priests from time immemorial, right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But you haven't released my sorrow. I am still suffering after a million years. What for? Help me to get rid of that. Help me to be free, without fear, then I'll find out. Is it that you want position, power, status, like the rest of the world? Now this is really quite serious.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think, you know, if we try to give the priests the most favourable interpretation, that they may have considered, at least, the best among them, that as a kind of poetic imagery that people may use to point to something beyond that, right, in a communication, and they are trying to point to this sacred which we were talking about. That's perhaps the way they would look at it. Now would you say that that would that make no sense, you know, to have a poetic image to point to the sacred.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But, sir, why don't you help me to see what is happening to me?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that's your point, don't point to the sacred right away but look at this first.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Help me to be free of it, then I'll walk.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I understand that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have never talked - nobody has gone into this like that. Always god, some saviour, some Brahma, and so on, so on. And this is what we call religion. All the rituals are invented by thought, marvellous architecture by thought, all the things inside the churches, temples, mosques, created by thought. And thought creates it, then thought worships it. But thought is not sacred.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, I see that. So you are saying, is it possible to put a stop to thought?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Thought. Is it possible?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And thought is the thing that gets in the way by creating the images...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>...which we take for something really valuable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I start out looking for something sacred. You come along and say, I'll tell you all about it. Then you begin to organize it. It's all gone by then, it's finished.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Then I just stay within thought, that's all I have.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, if we reject or understand that thought is not sacred, there's nothing holy about thought, but thought thinks that what it has created is holy. Right, sir?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right. Would you also add that time is not sacred.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Nothing in time, of course not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Nothing in time, or people would say that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Tomorrow is not sacred!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They always say only the eternal is sacred.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But to find out what is eternity, time must stop.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>But we get into a real subtle place here, because you have said things like, absolute attention dissolves the self. Then absolute attention can become a thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Idea of it, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes, the idea of it. So we may go the route of creating the idea. That seems to always be the danger.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You make a statement: absolute attention. I don't capture the depth of your meaning, what is implied. You have gone int it and you can say that, absolute attention. I hear it and make it into an idea. And then I pursue the idea.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>That seems to be the process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what we do all the time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So it has gone. Idea is not what you said. What you said had depth in it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>But we don't know that we're pursuing an idea. We don't realize at the time that we're pursuing an idea.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course not, because I am used to this reducing everything to abstract ideas. So could we try to find out or realize that anything though does is not sacred?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>That seems self-evident to me.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. That's self-evident. In all the religions as they are now, there is nothing sacred. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>No, there's nothing sacred in itself in the words or the buildings or so on. But in a sense all these religions are supposed to point beyond themselves.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And to help me to go beyond all this, I must start with my being free from my agony, understand my relationship with people. If there is confusion here, in my heart and my mind, what's the good of the other? I am not materialistic. I am not anti the other. But I say, look, I must start where I am. To go very far, I must start very near. I am very near. So I must understand myself. I'm the rest of humanity. I am not an individual. So, there is the book of humanity in me. I am that book. If I know how to read it from the beginning to the end, then I can I find if there is a possibility, if there is really something that is immense, sacred. But if you are all the time saying, look, there is that, that will help you, I say, it hasn't helped me. We have had these religions for millions of years. That hasn't - on the contrary, You have distracted from 'what is'.</p>
<p>So, if I want to find out if there is anything sacred, I must start very near. The very near is me. And can I free myself from fear and agony, sorrow, despair, all that? When there is freedom I can move, I can climb mountains.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Sir, are you saying that the sacred would become apparent if we dissolved fear and all these other things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously, sir. That's real meditation, you see.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Through attention to what is really happening in us.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>And what is really happening between us and other people and all the rest of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Between our relationships.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes. Through attention to this, this action...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...attention and we have discussed too with Dr Bohm, some time ago, having an insight into the whole movement of the self, which is not a remembrance. Insight is total perception of what you are, without analysis, without investigation, all that, total immediate perception of the whole content of your consciousness, not take bit by bit by bit, that's endless.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Oh, we're broken up so we look at each little piece.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And because we are broken up we can never see the whole. Obviously, that seems so logical!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Okay.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, is it possible not to be broken up? What is to be broken up? This confusion, this messy consciousness, which we talked about yesterday. You see nobody wants to go so deeply into all this. Right, sir? First of all, one hasn't the time; one is committed to one's job, to one's profession, to one's science, to one's whatever one is doing. And you say, please, this is too difficult or too abstract, not practical. That's the word they all use. As though all this, what you are doing and all is terribly practical. Our armaments, is it practical? Tribalism, is - oh well, you know all about it.</p>
<p>So, sir, let's move from there. Is silence of the mind a state of attention? Or is it beyond attention?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What would you mean by beyond attention? Let's try to get into that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is attention an act of will? I will attend.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>No, we said that's concentration.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, I am asking you, where there is attention is there any kind of effort? Struggle? I must attend. What is attention? Let's go into it a little bit. What is attention? The word diligent is implied in attention; to be diligent. Not negligent.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>What does diligent mean? Careful? You mean careful?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Care. To be very precise. Diligent.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The literal meaning is taking pains.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Pains, that's right. Taking pain. Which is to care, to have affection, to do everything correctly; orderly; not repetitive. Does attention demand the action of thought?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, it doesn't demand the action of analysis, in the way you've explained it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>...and insofar as thought is analytical, it doesn't demand that. And it doesn't demand the action of will insofar as will involves a separation, an attempt to, by one part of the mind, to force another part to do something else. It doesn't imply any sense of going anywhere or becoming anything because becoming leads one out of the present.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's right. You can't become attentive.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But in the act of attention...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Just see what is implied. You can't become attentive. That means in attention there is no time. Becoming implies time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In attention there is no time. Therefore it is not the result of thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now: is that attention silence of the mind? Which is a healthy, sane mind: uncluttered, unattached, unanchored, free mind, which is the healthiest mind. Therefore I am asking, in that attention, is the mind silent? There is no movement of thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, it sounds like it, yes. It sounds like a state of being rather than a state of becoming because it's not going anywhere, or coming from anywhere.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Again, when you say being, what does that mean? Being what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, being what it is. It's not being something else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, what does that mean, being? Are you putting being as a opposite to becoming?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, then. The opposite has its own opposite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, by being I simply mean a state which is not in a process of going somewhere else in time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means non-movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I suppose so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You could say that, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Non-movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If you say what you mean by movement, that it doesn't mean it's static to say it's non-movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it's dynamic, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you see it's a little difficult...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is no moving from here to there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But there is another kind of movement, perhaps.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That's what I want to go into. If we use the word being without movement, it is without thought, without time, which is the movement which we know. But the other has its own dynamism, its own movement, but not this movement, the time movement, the thought movement. Is that what you call being?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I suppose it is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that being silent? You follow, sir? We have various forms of silence. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes. It may not be silent in the sense of soundless.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am using the word 'silence' in the sense, without a single movement of thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, in that sense it must be silent almost by definition.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So, has my mind - the mind - has it stopped thinking? Has it - not stopped thinking - has thought found its own place and therefore it's no longer moving, chattering, pushing around. Because there is no controller. You follow? Because when there is a great silence, then that which is eternal is. You don't have to enquire about it. It's not a process. It isn't something you achieve, my God! By fasting, by rituals, by all these absurdities. Sir, you hear that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You hear X saying that. What value has it? Value in the sense, what do you do with it? Has it any importance or none at all? Because you are going your way. You are a psychologist, you'll go your way, I'll go my way, I have said what I have to say and there it ends. Then somebody comes along and says, I'll tell you what he means. You haven't the time. He has a little time, he says, I'll tell you all about it. And you are caught. This is what is happening. From the ancient of times, the Sumerians, the Egyptians, the Babylonians, they have played this. And we are doing still the same kind of nonsense. And what has religion done to man? It hasn't helped him. It has given him romantic illusory comfort. Actually look - we're killing each other - I won't go into that.</p>
<p>So, sir, let's begin. What is a healthy mind?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It's a mind that's not caught so in this...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A mind that's whole, healthy, sane, holy; h-o-l-y, holy. All that means a healthy mind. That's what we started discussing. What is a healthy mind? The world is so neurotic. How are we going to tell you, as an analyst, as a psychologist, how are you going to tell people what is a healthy mind, nobody's going to pay attention. They'll listen to the tape, to television, and they'll agree, but they'll go on their own way. So what do we do? First of all, do I have a healthy mind? Or is it just a lot of pictures, words, images? A mind that's totally unattached, to my country, to my ideas - all totally dispassionately unattached.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>And you are suggesting that only then am I in a position to talk to anybody?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously! Obviously. I may be married. I may, but why should I be attached to my wife?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Then it's an idea of marriage, it's not a marriage.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But love is not attachment. So have I realized that? A healthy mind that says, I love, therefore there is no attachment. Is that possible?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Sir, you make it sound so easy and so difficult at the same time because...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don't see why it's difficult.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Because you see, I hear what you say, I think this is absolutely wonderful stuff. I want to have a healthy mind, I want to be in a state of being, and then you see I realize that it's back into this, that I can't become in a state of having a healthy mind and I can't move by an act of will or desire into this state. It has to happen. And it can't happen through any act of my will.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. So.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>I have to let it happen in some sense.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So we begin to enquire. You begin to say, now, why? Why am I not healthy? Am I attached to my house? I need a house, why should I be attached to it. A wife, relationship, can't exist without relationship, life is relationship. But why should I be attached to a person? Or to an idea, to a faith, to a symbol, you follow? The whole cycle of it. To a nation, to my guru to my god, you follow? Attach mean attached right through. A mind can be free of all that. Of course it can.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But not just by wanting to be free of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. But seeing the consequences of it, seeing what is involved in it: the pain, the pleasure, the agony, the fear, you follow, all that is involved in that. Such a mind is an unhealthy mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes, but one can even agree with that, one can even see it, one can even see the movements of one's attachments, one can even see the destructive consequences of all this. But that doesn't in itself seem automatically to dissolve it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course not. So, it brings in quite a different question. Which is, sir, do you hear it, merely with your sensory ears or do you really hear it? You understand my question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it just casual verbal sensory hearing, or hearing at depth? If you hear it at the greatest depth, then it's part of you. I don't know if...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I think that generally one doesn't hear at the greatest depth and something is stopping it, you see. All the conditioning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And also probably we don't want to hear it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, but the conditioning makes us not want to hear it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We're unwilling to do so.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How can I say to my wife, I love you but I am not attached? She'll say, what the hell are you talking about? But if one sees the absolute necessity to have a healthy mind, and the demand for it, not only in myself, but in my children, my society.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>But you don't mean by that going around demanding of myself and other people that they become healthy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no, no. I demand in myself. I ask why is not my mind healthy? Why is it neurotic? Then I begin to enquire. I watch, I attend, I am diligent in what I am doing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems to me that you say that we must have to see the absolute necessity of a healthy mind, but I think we've been conditioned to the absolute necessity of maintaining attachment. And that's what we feel, right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, we haven't necessarily, you see, there are many people who've seen that there are all these problems, there's something wrong with the mind, they feel that something could be done about it and all that, and then take up some kind of spiritual practice, meditation, what not. Now you're saying that all these kinds of meditation, concentrating on chakras and what not are all just the same kind of thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I have played that trick long ago.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And I see the absurdity of all that. That is not going to stop thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>Well, some of these methods are supposed to. I don't know if they do or not, you see. They've never done it for me.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Sheldrake: </span>But I don't know if that's because I haven't done them right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So instead of going through all that business, why don't you find out. Let's find out what is thought, whether it can end, what is implied, you follow? Dig.</p>
<p>Sir, at the end of these four discussions, have you got healthy minds? Have you got a mind that is not confused, groping, floundering, demanding, asking? You follow, sir? What a business! It's like seeing a rattler and saying, yes, that's a rattler, I won't go near it. Finished!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>It looks from the inside like this is a tremendous deep problem that's very difficult to solve, and you're saying from the outside that it's just like seeing a rattler and you don't go near it, there's nothing to it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is like that with me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because I don't want to achieve nirvana or heaven or anything. I say, look - you follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well, I think it's interesting why it looks so deep when in fact it isn't.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, sir, we are all so very superficial. Right? And that seems to satisfy us. That's our good house, good wife, good job, good relationship, don't disturb anything. I'll go to church,you go to the mosque, I'll go to the temple, keep things as they are.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>Well then you're saying we don't even want to look at it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Hidley: </span>But say we come with a problem...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, if Mrs Thatcher and the gentleman in Argentina looked at it, how tribalistic they are, they would stop it. But they don't because the public doesn't want it. British - you follow? We are educated to be cruel to each other. I won't go into all that.</p>
<p>So, a healthy mind is that, sir. A healthy mind is without any conflict. And then it is a holistic mind. And then there's a possibility of that which is sacred to be. Otherwise all this is so childish.</p>
