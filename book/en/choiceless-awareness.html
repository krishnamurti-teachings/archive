<h1>Foreword</h1>

<p>This 'study book' is comprised of excerpts from the public talks, questions and answers, conversations, and writings of J. Krishnamurti on the subject of relationship. Krishnamurti speaks from such a large perspective that his whole vision can be implied by a given passage. To follow the thread of one's own inquiry, and to see how a passage is related to a whole discourse, one can refer to the sources provided at the end of each excerpt (a detailed bibliography can be found at the end of the volume). The intent of the teachings, and of these passages, is to serve as a springboard for further inquiry.</p>


<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Talking things over together as two friends...</p>
<p>In a few days we are going to have discussions, and we can start those discussions this morning. But if you assert and I assert, if you stick to your opinion, to your dogma, to your experience, to your knowledge, and I stick to mine, then there can be no real discussion because neither of us is free to inquire. To discuss is not to share our experiences with each other. There is no sharing at all; there is only the beauty of truth, which neither you nor I can possess. It is simply there.</p>
<p>To discuss intelligently, there must also be a quality not only of affection but of hesitation. You know, unless you hesitate, you can’t inquire. Inquiry means hesitating, finding out for yourself, discovering step by step; and when you do that, then you need not follow anybody, you need not ask for correction or for confirmation of your discovery. But all this demands a great deal of intelligence and sensitivity.</p>
<p>By saying that, I hope I have not stopped you from asking questions! You know, this is like talking things over together as two friends. We are neither asserting nor seeking to dominate each other, but each is talking easily, affably, in an atmosphere of friendly companionship, trying to discover. And in that state of mind we do discover, but I assure you, what we discover has very little importance. The important thing is to discover, and after discovering, to keep going. It is detrimental to stay with what you have discovered, for then your mind is closed, finished. But if you die to what you have discovered the moment you have discovered it, then you can flow like the stream, like a river that has an abundance of water.</p>

<h1>I. An Overview</h1>
<p>This journey I am proposing that we take together is not to the moon or even to the stars. The distance to the stars is much less than the distance within ourselves. The discovery of ourselves is endless, and it requires constant inquiry, a perception which is total, an awareness in which there is no choice. This journey is really an opening of the door to the individual in his relationship with the world.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A fundamental transformation of the mind...</p>
<p>Most of us must be aware that a fundamental change is necessary. We are confronted with so many problems, and there must be a different way&mdash;perhaps a totally different way&mdash;to approach all these problems. And it seems to me that, unless we understand the inward nature of this change, mere reformation, a revolution on the surface, will have very little significance. What is necessary, surely, is not a superficial change, not a temporary adjustment or conformity to a new pattern, but rather a fundamental transformation of the mind&mdash;a change that will be total, not just partial.</p>
<p>To understand this problem of change, it is necessary, first of all, to understand the process of thinking and the nature of knowledge. Unless we go into this rather deeply, any change will have very little meaning, because merely to change on the surface is to perpetuate the very things we are trying to alter. All revolutions set out to change the relationship of man to man, to create a better society, a different way of living; but, through the gradual process of time, the very abuses which the revolution was supposed to remove recur in another way with a different group of people, and the same old process goes on. We start out to change, to bring about a classless society, only to find that through time, through the pressure of circumstances, a different group becomes the new upper class. The revolution is never radical, fundamental.</p>
<p>So, it seems to me that superficial reformation or adjustment is meaningless when we are confronted with so many problems, and to bring about a lasting and significant change, we must see what change implies. We do change superficially under the pressure of circumstances: through propaganda, through necessity, or through the desire to conform to a particular pattern. I think one must be aware of this. A new invention, a political reformation, a war, a social revolution, a system of discipline&mdash;these things do change the mind of man, but only on the surface. And the man who earnestly wants to find out what is implied in a fundamental change must surely inquire into the whole process of thinking, that is, into the nature of the mind and knowledge.</p>
<p>So, if I may, I would like to talk over with you what is the mind, the nature of knowledge and what it means to know, because if we do not understand all that, I do not think there is any possibility of a new approach to our many problems, a new way of looking at life.</p>
<p>The lives of most us are pretty ugly, sordid, miserable, petty. Our existence is a series of conflicts, contradictions, a process of struggle, pain, fleeting joy, momentary satisfaction. We are bound by so many adjustments, conformities, patterns, and there is never a moment of freedom, never a sense of complete being. There is always frustration because there is always the seeking to fulfill. We have no tranquillity of mind, but are always tortured by various demands. So, to understand all these problems and go beyond them, it is surely necessary that we begin by understanding the nature of knowledge and the process of the mind.</p>
<p>Knowledge implies a sense of accumulation, does it not? Knowledge can be acquired and, because of its nature, knowledge is always partial, it is never complete; therefore, all action springing from knowledge is also partial, incomplete. I think we must see that very clearly.</p>
<p>I hesitate to go on, because, if we are to understand as we go along, we must commune with each other, and I am not sure there is any communion between us. Communion implies understanding, not only the significance of the words, but also the meaning beyond the words, does it not? If your mind and the speaker’s mind are moving together in understanding, with sensitivity, then there is a possibility of real communion with each other. But if you are merely listening to find out at the end of the talk what I mean by knowledge, then we are not in communion; you are merely waiting for a definition, and definitions, surely, are not the way of understanding.</p>
<p>So the question arises: What is understanding? What is the state of the mind that understands? When you say, “I understand,” what do you mean by it? Understanding is not mere intellection; it is not the outcome of argumentation; it has nothing to do with acceptance, denial, or conviction. On the contrary, acceptance, denial, and conviction prevent understanding. To understand, surely, there must be a state of attention in which there is no sense of comparison or condemnation, no waiting for a further development of the thing we are talking about, in order to agree or disagree. There is an abeyance or suspension of all opinion, of all sense of condemnation or comparison; you are just listening to find out. Your approach is one of inquiry, which means that you don’t start from a conclusion; therefore, you are in a state of attention, which is really listening.</p>
<p>Now, is it possible, in such a large crowd, to commune with each other? I would like to go into this problem of knowledge, however difficult, because if we can understand the problem of knowledge, then I think we shall be able to go beyond the mind; and in going beyond or transcending itself, the mind may be without limitation, that is, without effort, which places a limitation on consciousness. Unless we go beyond the mechanistic process of the mind, real creativeness is obviously impossible, and what is necessary, surely, is a mind that is creative, so that it is able to deal with all these multiplying problems. To understand what is knowledge and go beyond the partial, the limited, to experience that which is creative, requires not just a moment of perception but a continuous awareness, a continuous state of inquiry in which there is no conclusion&mdash;and this, after all, is intelligence.</p>
<p>So, if you are listening, not merely with your ears, but with a mind that really wishes to understand, a mind that has no authority, that does not start with a conclusion or a quotation, that has no desire to be proved right, but is aware of these innumerable problems and sees the necessity of solving them directly&mdash;if that is the state of your mind, then I think we can commune with each other. Otherwise, you will merely be left with a lot of words.</p>
<p>As I was saying, all knowledge is partial, and any action born of knowledge is also partial, and therefore contradictory. If you are at all aware of yourself, of your activities, of your motivations, of your thoughts and desires, you will know that you live in a state of selfcontradiction: “I want,” and at the same time, “I do not want; this I must do, that I must not do,” and so on and so on. The mind is in a state of contradiction all the time. And the more acute the contradiction, the more confusion your action creates. That is, when there is a challenge which must be answered, which cannot be avoided or from which you cannot escape, then, your mind being in a state of contradiction, the tension of having to face that challenge forces an action; and such action produces further contradiction, further misery.</p>
<p>I do not know if it is clear to each one of us that we live in a state of contradiction: We talk about peace and prepare for war. We talk about nonviolence and are fundamentally violent. We talk about being good and we are not. We talk about love and we are full of ambition, competitiveness, ruthless efficiency. So, there is contradiction. The action which springs from that contradiction only brings about frustration and further contradiction. Knowledge being incomplete, any action born of that knowledge is bound to be contradictory. Our problem, then, is to find a source of action which is not partial&mdash;to discover it now, so as to create an immediate action which is total, and not say, “I will find it through some system, at some future time.”</p>
<p>You see, sirs, all thought is partial; it can never be total. Thought is the response of memory, and memory is always partial because memory is the result of experience, so thought is the reaction of a mind which is conditioned by experience. All thinking, all experience, all knowledge is inevitably partial; therefore, thought cannot solve the many problems that we have. You may try to reason logically, sanely about these many problems; but if you observe your own mind you will see that your thinking is conditioned by your circumstances, by the culture in which you were born, by the food you eat, by the climate you live in, by the newspapers you read, by the pressures and influences of your daily life. You are conditioned as a communist, or a socialist, as a Hindu, a Catholic, or what you will; you are conditioned to believe or not to believe. And because the mind is conditioned by its belief or nonbelief, by its knowledge, by its experience, all thinking is partial. There is no thinking which is free.</p>
<p>So, we must understand very clearly that our thinking is the response of memory, and memory is mechanistic. Knowledge is ever incomplete, and all thinking born of knowledge is limited, partial, never free. So there is no freedom of thought. But we can begin to discover a freedom which is not a process of thought, and in which the mind is simply aware of all its conflicts and of all the influences impinging upon it.</p>
<p>What do we mean by learning? Is there learning when you are merely accumulating knowledge, gathering information? That is one kind of learning, is it not? As a student of engineering, you study mathematics, and so on; you are learning, informing yourself about the subject; you are accumulating knowledge in order to use that knowledge in practical ways. Your learning is accumulative, additive. Now, when the mind is merely taking on, adding, acquiring, is it learning? Or, is learning something entirely different? I say the additive process which we now call learning is not learning at all: it is merely a cultivation of memory, which becomes mechanical; and a mind which functions mechanically, like a machine, is not capable of learning. A machine is never capable of learning, except in the additive sense. Learning is something quite different, as I shall try to show you.</p>
<p>A mind that is learning never says, “I know,” because knowledge is always partial, whereas learning is complete all the time. Learning does not mean starting with a certain amount of knowledge and adding to it further knowledge. That is not learning at all; it is a purely mechanistic process. To me, learning is something entirely different: I am learning about myself from moment to moment, and the ‘myself ’ is extraordinarily vital; it is living, moving, it has no beginning and no end. When I say, “I know myself,” learning has come to an end in accumulated knowledge. Learning is never cumulative; it is a movement of knowing which has no beginning and no end.</p>
<p>Sirs, the problem is this: Is it possible for the mind to free itself from this mechanistic accumulation called knowledge? And, can one find that out through the process of thinking? Do you understand? You and I realize that we are conditioned. If you say, as some people do, that conditioning is inevitable, then there is no problem; you are a slave, and that is the end of it. But, if you begin to ask yourself whether it is at all possible to break down this limitation, this conditioning, then there is a problem; so you will have to inquire into the whole process of thinking, will you not? If you merely say, “I must be aware of my conditioning; I must think about it, analyze it in order to understand and destroy it,” then you are exercising force. Your thinking, your analyzing, is still the result of your background, so through your thought you obviously cannot break down the conditioning of which it is a part.</p>
<p>Just see the problem first, don’t ask what is the answer, the solution. The fact is that we are conditioned, and that all thought to understand this conditioning will always be partial; therefore, there is never a total comprehension, and only in total comprehension of the whole process of thinking is there freedom. The difficulty is that we are always functioning within the field of the mind, which is the instrument of thought, reasonable or unreasonable; and, as we have seen, thought is always partial. I am sorry to repeat that word, but we think that thought will solve our problems; and I wonder if it will?</p>
<p>To me, the mind is a total thing. It is the intellect; it is the emotions; it is the capacity to observe, distinguish; it is that center of thought which says, “I will” and “I will not”; it is desire; it is fulfillment. It is the whole thing, not something intellectual apart from the emotional. We exercise thought as a means of resolving our problems. But thought is not the means of resolving any of our problems, because thought is the response of memory, and memory is the result of accumulated knowledge as experience. Realizing this, what is the mind to do? Do you understand the problem?</p>
<p>I am full of ambition, the desire for power, position, prestige, and I also feel that I must know what love is; so I am in a state of contradiction. A man who is after power, position, prestige, has no love at all, though he may talk about it; and any integration of the two is impossible, however much he may desire it. Love and power cannot join hands. So, what is the mind to do? Thought, we see, will only create further contradictions, further misery. So, can the mind be aware of this problem without introducing thought into it at all? Do you understand, or am I talking Greek?</p>
<p>Sirs, let me put it in still another way. Has it ever happened to you&mdash; I am sure it has&mdash;that you suddenly perceive something, and in that moment of perception you have no problems at all? The very moment you have perceived the problem, the problem has completely ceased. Do you understand, sirs? You have a problem, and you think about it, argue with it, worry over it; you exercise every means within the limits of your thought to understand it. Finally you say, “I can do no more.” There is nobody to help you to understand, no guru, no book. You are left with the problem, and there is no way out. Having inquired into the problem to the full extent of your capacity, you leave it alone. Your mind is no longer worried, no longer tearing at the problem, no longer saying, “I must find an answer”; so it becomes quiet, does it not? And, in that quietness, you find the answer. Hasn’t that sometimes happened to you? It is not an enormous thing; it happens to great mathematicians, scientists, and people experience it occasionally in everyday life. Which means what? The mind has exercised fully its capacity to think, and has come to the edge of all thought without having found an answer; therefore, it becomes quiet&mdash;not through weariness, not through fatigue, not by saying, “I will be quiet and thereby find the answer.” Having already done everything possible to find the answer, the mind becomes spontaneously quiet. There is an awareness without choice, without any demand, an awareness in which there is no anxiety; and in that state of mind there is perception. It is this perception alone that will resolve all our problems.</p>
<p>All thinking is limited because thinking is the response of memory&mdash;memory as experience, memory as the accumulation of knowledge&mdash;and it is mechanistic. Being mechanistic, thinking will not solve our problems. This does not mean that we must stop thinking. But an altogether new factor is necessary. We have tried various methods and systems, various ways... and they have all failed. Man is still in misery; he is still groping, seeking in the torture of despair, and there is seemingly no end to his sorrow. So there must be a totally new factor which is not recognizable by the mind. Do you follow?</p>
<p>Surely, the mind is the instrument of recognition, and anything that the mind recognizes is already known; therefore, it is not the new. It is still within the field of thought, of memory, and hence mechanistic. So, the mind must be in a state where it perceives without the process of recognition.</p>
<p>Now, what is that state? It has nothing to do with thought; it has nothing to do with recognition. Recognition and thought are mechanistic. It is, if I may put it this way, a state of perception and nothing else&mdash;that is, a state of being.</p>
<p>Look, sirs, most of us are petty people, with very shallow minds, and the thinking of a narrow, shallow mind can only lead to further misery. A shallow mind cannot make itself deep; it will always be shallow, petty, envious. What it can do is to realize the fact that it is shallow, and not make an effort to alter it. The mind sees that it is conditioned, and has no urge to change that conditioning because it understands that any compulsion to change is the result of knowledge, which is partial; therefore, it is in a state of perception. It is perceiving what is. But, generally, what happens? Being envious, the mind exercises thought to get rid of envy, thereby creating the opposite as non-envy, but it is still within the field of thought. Now, if the mind perceives the state of envy without condemning or accepting it, and without introducing the desire to change, then it is in a state of perception; and that very perception brings about a new movement, a new element, a totally different quality of being.</p>
<p>You see, sirs, words, explanations, and symbols are one thing, and being is something entirely different. Here we are not concerned with words, we are concerned with being&mdash;being what we actually are, not dreaming of ourselves as spiritual entities, the atman and all that nonsense, which is still within the field of thought, and therefore partial. What matters is being what you are&mdash;envious&mdash;and perceiving that totally, and you can perceive it totally only when there is no movement of thought at all. The mind is the movement of thought&mdash;and it is also the state in which there is complete perception, without the movement of thought. Only that state of perception can bring about a radical change in the ways of our thinking; and then thinking will not be mechanistic.</p>
<p>So, what we are concerned with is, surely, to be aware of this whole process of the mind, with its limitations, and not make an effort to remove those limitations; to see completely, totally, what is. You cannot see totally what is unless all thinking is in abeyance. In that state of awareness there is no choice, and only that state can resolve our problems.</p>

<h1>II. The Nature of Choiceless Awareness</h1>
<p class="q"><b><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Questioner: What is the difference between awareness and sensitivity?</b></p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wonder if there is any difference? You know, when you ask a question, what is important is to find out for yourself the truth of the matter and not merely accept what someone else says. So, let us find out together what it is to be aware.</p>
<p>You see a lovely tree with its leaves sparkling after the rain; you see the sunlight shining on the water and on the gray-hued feathers of the birds; you see the villagers walking to town carrying heavy burdens, and hear their laughter; you hear the bark of a dog, or a calf calling to its mother. All this is part of awareness, the awareness of what is around you, is it not? Coming a little closer, you notice your relationship to people, to ideas and to things; you are aware of how you regard the house, the road; you observe your reactions to what people say to you, and how your mind is always evaluating, judging, comparing, or condemning. This is all part of awareness, which begins on the surface and then goes deeper and deeper, but for most of us awareness stops at a certain point. We take in the noises, the songs, the beautiful and ugly sights, but we are not aware of our reactions to them. We say, “That is beautiful,” or, “That is ugly,” and pass by; we don’t inquire into what beauty is, what ugliness is. Surely, to see what your reactions are, to be more and more alert to every movement of your own thought, to observe that your mind is conditioned by the influence of your parents, of your teachers, of your race and culture&mdash;all this is part of awareness, is it not?</p>
<p class="right"><i>Think on These Things</i>, pp. 202-3</p>

<hr class="separator">

<p class="subtitle">You can’t be totally aware if you are choosing.</p>
<p>Awareness isn’t something mysterious that you must practice; it isn’t something that can be learned only from the speaker, or from some bearded gentleman or other. All that kind of fanciful stuff is too absurd. Just to be aware&mdash;what does it mean? To be aware that you are sitting there and I am sitting here; that I am talking to you and you are listening to me; to be aware of this hall, its shape, its lighting, its acoustics; to observe the various colors that people wear, their attitudes, their effort to listen, their scratching, yawning, boredom, their dissatisfaction at not being able to get from what they hear something to carry home with them; their agreement or disagreement with what is being said. All that is part of awareness&mdash;a very superficial part.</p>
<p>Behind that superficial observation there is the response of our conditioning: I like and I don’t like, I am British and you are not British, I am a Catholic and you are a Protestant. And our conditioning is really very deep. It requires a great deal of investigation, understanding. To be conscious of our reactions, of our hidden motives and conditioned responses, this also is part of awareness.</p>
<p>You can’t be totally aware if you are choosing. If you say, “This is right and that is wrong,” the right and the wrong depend on your conditioning. What is right to you may be wrong in the Far East. You believe in a savior, in the Christ, but they don’t, and you think they will go to hell unless they believe as you do. You have the means to build marvelous cathedrals, while they may worship a stone image, a tree, a bird, or a rock, and you say, “How silly, how pagan!” To be aware is to be conscious of all this, choicelessly, it is to be aware totally of all your conscious and unconscious reactions. And you can’t be aware totally if you are condemning, if you are justifying, or if you say, “I will keep my beliefs, my experiences, my knowledge.” Then you are only partially aware, and partial awareness is really blindness.</p>
<p>Seeing or understanding is not a matter of time, it is not a matter of gradations. Either you see or you don’t see. And you can’t see if you are not deeply aware of your own reactions, of your own conditioning. Being aware of your conditioning, you must watch it choicelessly; you must see the fact and not give an opinion or judgment about the fact. In other words, you must look at the fact without thought. Then there is an awareness, a state of attention without a center, without frontiers, where the known doesn’t interfere...</p>

<hr class="separator">

<p class="subtitle">Being fully conscious of one’s whole process of thinking, and being able to go beyond that process, is awareness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Does awareness mean a state of freedom, or merely a process of observation?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>This is really quite a complex problem. Can we understand the whole significance of what it is to be aware? Do not let us jump to any conclusions. What do we mean by ordinary awareness? I see you and, in watching you, looking at you, I form opinions. You have hurt me, you have deceived me, you have been cruel to me, or you have said nice things and flattered me, and consciously or unconsciously all this remains in my mind. When I watch this process, when I observe it, that is just the beginning of awareness, is it not? I can also be aware of my motives, of my habits of thought. The mind can be aware of its limitations, of its own conditioning, and there is the inquiry as to whether the mind can ever be free from its own conditioning. Surely this is all part of awareness. To say that the mind can or cannot be free from its conditioning is still part of its conditioning, but to observe that conditioning without saying either is a furthering of awareness&mdash; awareness of the whole process of thinking.</p>
<p>So, through awareness I begin to see myself as I actually am, the totality of myself. Being watchful from moment to moment of all its thoughts, its feelings, its reactions, unconscious as well as conscious, the mind is constantly discovering the significance of its own activities, which is self-knowledge. Whereas, if my understanding is merely accumulative, then that accumulation becomes a conditioning which prevents further understanding. So, can the mind observe itself without accumulation?</p>
<p>All this is still only part of awareness, is it not? A tree is not merely the leaf or the flower or the fruit; it is also the branch, the trunk: it is everything that goes to make up the whole tree. Likewise, awareness is of the total process of the mind, not just of one particular segment of that process. But the mind cannot understand the total process of itself if it condemns or justifies any part, or identifies itself with the pleasurable and rejects the painful. So long as the mind is merely accumulating experience, knowledge&mdash;which is what it is doing all the time&mdash;it is incapable of going further. That is why to discover something new, there must be a dying to every experience, and for this there must be awareness from moment to moment.</p>
<p>All relationship is a mirror in which the mind can discover its own operations. Relationship is between oneself and other human beings, between oneself and things or property, between oneself and ideas, and between oneself and nature. And, in that mirror of relationship, one can see oneself as one actually is, but only if one is capable of looking without judging, without evaluating, condemning, justifying. When one has a fixed point from which one observes, there is no understanding in one’s observation.</p>
<p>So, being fully conscious of one’s whole process of thinking, and being able to go beyond that process, is awareness. You may say it is very difficult to be so constantly aware. Of course it is very difficult&mdash;it is almost impossible. You cannot keep a mechanism working at full speed all the time; it would break up; it must slow down, have rest. Similarly, we cannot maintain total awareness all the time. How can we? To be aware from moment to moment is enough. If one is totally aware for a minute or two and then relaxes, and in that relaxation spontaneously observes the operations of one’s own mind, one will discover much more in that spontaneity than in the effort to watch continuously. You can observe yourself effortlessly, easily&mdash;when you are walking, talking, reading&mdash;at every moment. Only then will you find out that the mind is capable of freeing itself from all the things it has known and experienced, and it is in freedom alone that it can discover what is true.</p>

<p class="subtitle">When you say, “I must be aware all the time,” you have made a problem of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I find it impossible to be aware all the time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don’t be aware all the time! Just be aware in little bits. Please, there is no being aware all the time&mdash;that is a dreadful idea! It is a nightmare, this terrible desire for continuity. Just be aware for one minute, for one second, and in that one second of awareness you can see the whole universe. That is not a poetic phrase. We see things in a flash, in a single moment; but, having seen something, we want to capture, to hold it, give it continuity. That is not being aware at all. When you say, “I must be aware all the time,” you have made a problem of it, and then you should really find out why you want to be aware all the time. See the greed it implies, the desire to acquire. And to say, “Well, I am aware all the time,” means nothing.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Out of this awareness there comes a clarity that is not induced.</p>
<p>If you sit on the bank of a river after a storm, you see the stream going by, carrying a great deal of debris. Similarly, you have to watch the movement of yourself&mdash;following every thought, every feeling, every intention, every motive&mdash;just watch it. That watching is also listening; it is being aware with your eyes, with your ears, with your insight, of all the values that human beings have created, and by which you are conditioned, and it is only this state of total awareness that will end all seeking.</p>
<p>Please do listen to this. Most of us think that awareness is a mysterious something to be practiced, and that we should get together day after day to talk about awareness. Now, you don’t come to awareness that way at all. But if you are aware of outward things&mdash;the curve of a road, the shape of a tree, the color of another’s dress, the outline of the mountains against a blue sky, the delicacy of a flower, the pain on the face of a passerby, the ignorance, the envy, the jealousy of others, the beauty of the earth&mdash;then, seeing all these outward things without condemnation, without choice, you can ride on the tide of inner awareness. Then you will become aware of your own reactions, of your own pettiness, of your own jealousies. From the outward awareness you come to the inward, but if you are not aware of the outer you cannot possibly come to the inner.</p>
<p>When there is inward awareness of every activity of your mind and your body, when you are aware of your thoughts, of your feelings, both secret and open, conscious and unconscious, then out of this awareness there comes a clarity that is not induced, not put together by the mind. And without that clarity you may do what you will, you may search the heavens and the earth and the deeps, but you will never find out what is true.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The <i>what is</i> is what you are, not what you would like to be.</p>
<p>The what is is what you are, not what you would like to be; it is not the ideal because the ideal is fictitious, but it is actually what you are doing, thinking, and feeling from moment to moment. What is is the actual, and to understand the actual requires awareness, a very alert, swift mind.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The awareness of which I speak is of what is from moment to moment.</p>
<p>Understanding comes with the awareness of what is. There can be no understanding if there is condemnation of or identification with what is. If you condemn a child or identify yourself with him, then you cease to understand him. So, being aware of a thought or a feeling as it arises, without condemning it or identifying with it, you will find that it unfolds ever more widely and deeply, and thereby discover the whole content of what is. To understand the process of what is there must be choiceless awareness, a freedom from condemnation, justification, and identification. When you are vitally interested in fully understanding something, you give your mind and heart, withholding nothing. But unfortunately you are conditioned, educated, disciplined through religious and social environment to condemn or to identify, and not to understand. To condemn is stupid and easy, but to understand is arduous, requiring pliability and intelligence. Condemnation, as identification, is a form of self-protection. Condemnation or identification is a barrier to understanding. To understand the confusion, the misery in which one is, and so of the world, you must observe its total process. To be aware and pursue all its implications requires patience, to follow swiftly, and to be still.</p>
<p>There is understanding only when there is stillness, when there is silent observation, passive awareness. Then only the problem yields its full significance. The awareness of which I speak is of what is from moment to moment, of the activities of thought and its subtle deceptions, fears, and hope. Choiceless awareness wholly dissolves our conflicts and miseries.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The beauty of listening</p>
<p>The beauty of listening lies in being highly sensitive to everything about you: to the ugliness, to the dirt, to the squalor, to the poverty about you, and also to the dirt, to the disorder, to the poverty of one’s own being. When you are aware of both, then there is no effort, that is, when there is an awareness which is without choice, then there is no effort.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Awareness is non-effort.</p>
<p>Does not effort mean a struggle to change what is into what it is not, or what it should be, or what it should become? We are constantly escaping from what is, to transform or modify it....</p>
<p>Only when there is no awareness of exactly what is, then effort to transform takes place. So, effort is non-awareness. Awareness reveals the significance of what is, and the complete acceptance of the significance brings freedom. So, awareness is non-effort; awareness is the perception of what is without distortion. Distortion exists whenever there is effort.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Do it, and you will see.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Sir, if there is no effort, if there is no method, then any transition into the state of awareness, any shift into a new dimension, must be a completely random accident, and therefore unaffected by anything you might say on the subject.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, no, sir! I didn’t say that. [Laughter] I said one has to be aware. By being aware, one discovers how one is conditioned. By being aware, I know I am conditioned&mdash;as a Hindu, as a Buddhist, as a Christian; I am conditioned as a nationalist: British, German, Russian, Indian, American, Chinese&mdash;I am conditioned. We never tackle that. That’s the garbage we are, and we hope something marvelous will grow out of it, but I am afraid it is not possible. Being aware doesn’t mean a chance happening, something irresponsible and vague. If one understands the implications of awareness, one’s body not only becomes highly sensitive, but the whole entity is activated; there is a new energy given to it. Do it, and you will see. Don’t sit on the bank and speculate about the river; jump in and follow the current of this awareness, and you will find out for yourself how extraordinarily limited our thoughts, our feelings, and our ideas are. Our projections of gods, saviors, and Masters&mdash;all that becomes so obvious, so infantile.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Awareness takes place when one observes...</p>
<p>You know, concentration is effort: focusing upon a particular page, an idea, image, symbol, and so on and so on. Concentration is a process of exclusion. You tell a student, “Don’t look out of the window; pay attention to the book.” He wants to look out, but he forces himself to look, look at the page; so there is a conflict. This constant effort to concentrate is a process of exclusion, which has nothing to do with awareness. Awareness takes place when one observes&mdash;you can do it; everybody can do it&mdash;observes not only what is the outer, the tree, what people say, what one thinks, and so on, outwardly, but also inwardly to be aware without choice, just to observe without choosing. For when you choose, when choice takes place, only then is there confusion, not when there is clarity.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Awareness is not self-improvement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>What is the difference between awareness and introspection? And, who is aware in awareness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let us first examine what we mean by introspection. We mean by introspection looking within oneself, examining oneself. Why does one examine oneself? In order to improve, in order to change, in order to modify. You introspect in order to become something, otherwise you would not indulge in introspection. You would not examine yourself if there were not the desire to modify, change, to become something other than what you are. That is the obvious reason for introspection. I am angry and I introspect, examine myself, in order to get rid of anger or to modify or change anger. Where there is introspection, which is the desire to modify or change the responses, the reactions of the ‘self ’, there is always an end in view. When that end is not achieved, there is moodiness, depression; therefore, introspection invariably goes with depression. I don’t know if you have noticed that when you introspect, when you look into yourself in order to change yourself, there is always a wave of depression; there is always a moody wave which you have to battle against; you have to examine yourself again in order to overcome that mood, and so on. Introspection is a process in which there is no release because it is a process of transforming what is into something which it is not. Obviously, that is exactly what is taking place when we introspect, when we indulge in that peculiar action. In that action, there is always an accumulative process, the ‘I’ examining something in order to change it, so there is always a dualistic conflict and therefore a process of frustration. There is never a release; and, realizing that frustration, there is depression.</p>
<p>Awareness is entirely different: awareness is observation without condemnation. Awareness brings understanding, because there is no condemnation or identification but silent observation. If I want to understand something, I must observe, I must not criticize, I must not condemn, I must not pursue it as pleasure or avoid it as non-pleasure. There must merely be the silent observation of a fact. There is no end in view but awareness of everything as it arises. That observation and the understanding of that observation cease when there is condemnation, identification, or justification. Introspection is self-improvement and therefore introspection is self-centeredness. Awareness is not selfimprovement. On the contrary, it is the ending of the self, of the ‘I’, with all its peculiar idiosyncrasies, memories, demands, and pursuits. In introspection there is identification and condemnation. In awareness there is no condemnation or identification; therefore, there is no selfimprovement. There is a vast difference between the two.</p>
<p>The man who wants to improve himself can never be aware, because improvement implies condemnation and the achievement of a result; whereas, in awareness there is observation without condemnation, without denial or acceptance. That awareness begins with outward things, being aware, being in contact with objects, with nature. First, there is awareness of things about one, being sensitive to objects, to nature, then to people, which means relationship; then there is awareness of ideas. This awareness&mdash;being sensitive to things, to nature, to people, to ideas&mdash;is not made up of separate processes, but is one unitary process. It is a constant observation of everything, of every thought and feeling and action as they arise within oneself. As awareness is not condemnatory, there is no accumulation. You condemn only when you have a standard, which means there is accumulation and therefore improvement of the self. Awareness is to understand the activities of the self, the ‘I’, in its relationship with people, with ideas and with things. That awareness is from moment to moment and therefore it cannot be practiced. When you practice a thing, it becomes a habit, and awareness is not habit. A mind that is habitual is insensitive, a mind that is functioning within the groove of a particular action is dull, unpliable; whereas, awareness demands constant pliability, alertness. This is not difficult. It is what you actually do when you are interested in something, when you are interested in watching your child, your wife, your plants, the trees, the birds. You observe without condemnation, without identification; therefore, in that observation there is complete communion: the observer and the observed are completely in communion. This actually takes place when you are deeply, profoundly interested in something.</p>
<p>Thus, there is a vast difference between awareness and the selfexpansive improvement of introspection. Introspection leads to frustration, to further and greater conflict; whereas, awareness is a process of release from the action of the self; it is to be aware of your daily movements, of your thoughts, of your actions, and to be aware of another, to observe him. You can do that only when you love somebody, when you are deeply interested in something. When I want to know myself, my whole being, the whole content of myself and not just one or two layers, then there obviously must be no condemnation; then I must be open to every thought, to every feeling, to all the moods, to all the suppressions. And, as there is more and more expansive awareness, there is greater and greater freedom from all the hidden movement of thoughts, motives, and pursuits. Awareness is freedom, it brings freedom, it yields freedom, whereas introspection cultivates conflict, the process of self-enclosure; therefore, there is always frustration and fear in it.</p>
<p>The questioner also wants to know who is aware. When you have a profound experience of any kind, what is taking place? When there is such an experience, are you aware that you are experiencing? When you are angry, at the split second of anger or of jealousy or of joy, are you aware that you are joyous or that you are angry? It is only when the experience is over that there is the experiencer and the experienced. Then the experiencer observes the experienced, the object of experience. At the moment of experience, there is neither the observer nor the observed: there is only the experiencing. Most of us are not experiencing; we are always outside the state of experiencing, and therefore we ask this question as to who is the observer, who is it that is aware? Surely such a question is a wrong question, is it not? The moment there is experiencing, there is neither the person who is aware nor the object of which he is aware; there is neither the observer nor the observed but only a state of experiencing. Most of us find it is extremely difficult to live in a state of experiencing, because that demands an extraordinary pliability, a quickness, a high degree of sensitivity; and that is denied when we are pursuing a result, when we want to succeed, when we have an end in view, when we are calculating&mdash;all of which brings frustration. A man who does not demand anything, who is not seeking an end, who is not searching out a result with all its implications, such a man is in a state of constant experiencing. Everything then has a movement, a meaning; nothing is old, nothing is charred, nothing is repetitive, because what is is never old. The challenge is always new; it is only the response to the challenge that is old. The old creates further residue, which is memory, the observer, who separates himself from the observed, from the challenge, from the experience.</p>
<p>You can experiment with this for yourself very simply and very easily. Next time you are angry or jealous or greedy or violent or whatever it may be, watch yourself. In that state, ‘you’ are not: there is only that state of being. The moment, the second afterwards, you term it, you name it, you call it jealousy, anger, greed; so you have created immediately the observer and the observed, the experiencer and the experienced. When there is the experiencer and the experienced, then the experiencer tries to modify the experience, change it, remember things about it and so on, and therefore maintains the division between himself and the experienced. If you don’t name that feeling&mdash;which means you are not seeking a result, you are not condemning, you are merely silently aware of the feeling&mdash;then you will see that, in that state of feeling, of experiencing, there is no observer and no observed, because the observer and the observed are a joint phenomenon and so there is only experiencing.</p>
<p>Therefore, introspection and awareness are entirely different. Introspection leads to frustration, to further conflict, for in it is implied the desire for change, and change is merely a modified continuity. Awareness is a state in which there is no condemnation, no justification or identification, and therefore there is understanding; in that state of passive, alert awareness there is neither the experiencer nor the experienced.</p>
<p>Introspection, which is a form of self-improvement, of selfexpansion, can never lead to truth, because it is always a process of self-enclosure; whereas, awareness is a state in which truth can come into being, the truth of what is, the simple truth of daily existence. It is only when we understand the truth of daily existence that we can go far. You must begin near to go far, but most of us want to jump, to begin far without understanding what is close. As we understand the near, we shall find the distance between the near and the far is not. There is no distance&mdash;the beginning and the end are one.</p>

<h1>III. The Division between the Observer and the Observed</h1>
<p class="subtitle">How can a process observe itself?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I think it is rather important to know what we mean by seeing and watching. You have said that there is no motive or center, but only a process. How can a process watch another process?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>This is like a cross-examination! Surely you are not trying to trap me, and I am not trying to answer cleverly. What we are trying to do is to understand the problem, which is very complex, and one or two questions and responses are not going to solve it. But what we can do is to approach it from different directions and look at it as patiently as possible.</p>
<p>So, the question is this: If there is only a process, and not a center which observes the process, then how can a process observe itself? The process is active, moving, changing, all the time in motion, and how can that process watch itself if there is no center? I hope the question is clear to you; otherwise, what I am going to say will have no meaning.</p>
<p>If the whole of life is a movement, a flux, then how can it be watched unless there is a watcher? Now, we are conditioned to believe, and we feel we know, that there is a watcher as well as a movement, a process, so we think we are separate from the process. To most of us there is the thinker and the thought, the experiencer and the experience. For us that is so; we accept it as a matter of fact. But is it so? Is there a thinker, an observer, a watcher apart from thought, apart from thinking, apart from experience? Is there a thinker, a center, without thought? If you remove thought, is there a center? If you have no thought at all, no struggle, no urge to acquire, no effort to become something, is there a center? Or, is the center created by thought, which feels itself to be insecure, impermanent, in a state of flux? If you observe, you will find that it is the thought process that has created the center, which is still within the field of thinking. And is it possible&mdash;this is the point&mdash;to watch, to be aware of this process, without the watcher? Can the mind, which is the process, be aware of itself?</p>
<p>Please, this requires a great deal of insight, meditation, and penetration, because most of us assume that there is a thinker apart from thinking. But if you go into it a little more closely, you will see that thought has created the thinker. The thinker who is directing, who is the center, the judge, is the outcome of our thoughts. This is a fact, as you will see if you are really looking at it. Most people are conditioned to believe that the thinker is separate from thought, and they give to the thinker the quality of eternality, but that which is beyond time comes into being only when we understand the whole process of thinking.</p>
<p>Now, can the mind be aware of itself in action, in movement, without a center? I think it can. It is possible when there is only an awareness of thinking, and not the thinker who is thinking. You know, it is quite an experience to realize that there is only thinking. And it is very difficult to experience that because the thinker is habitually there, evaluating, judging, condemning, comparing, identifying. If the thinker ceases to identify, evaluate, judge, then there is only thinking, without the center.</p>
<p>What is the center? The center is the ‘me’: the ‘me’ that wants to be a great person, that has so many conclusions, fears, motives. From that center we think, but that center has been created by the reaction of thinking. So, can the mind be aware of thinking without the center&mdash; just observe it? You will find how extraordinarily difficult it is just to look at a flower without naming it, without comparing it with other flowers, without evaluating it out of like or dislike. Experiment with this and you will see how really difficult it is to observe something without bringing in all your prejudices, all your emotions and evaluations. But, however difficult, you will find that the mind can be aware of itself without the center watching the movement of the mind.</p>

<p class="subtitle">My relationship undergoes a tremendous revolution.</p>
<p>I generally look at my wife, husband, at a person, with all my prejudices and memories. Through those memories I look; that is the center from which I look; therefore, the observer is different from the thing observed. In that process thought is constantly interfering, through association, and with the rapidity of the association. Now, when I realize the whole implication of that instantly, there is an observation without the observer. It is very simple to do this with trees, with nature; but with human beings, what takes place? If I can look at my wife or my husband non-verbally, not as an observer, it is rather frightening, isn’t it? Because my relationship with her or with him is quite different. It is not in any sense personal; it is not a matter of pleasure, and I am afraid of it. I can look at a tree without fear, because it is fairly easy to commune with nature, but to commune with human beings is much more dangerous and frightening; my relationship undergoes a tremendous revolution. Before, I possessed my wife, and she possessed me; we liked being possessed. We were living in our own isolated, selfidentifying space. In observing, I removed that space; I am now directly in contact. I look without the observer, and therefore without a center. Unless one understands this whole problem, merely to develop a technique of looking becomes frightful. Then one becomes cynical, and all the rest of it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">If you can look... without the observer, a totally different action takes place.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>If we are all that background, the past, who is the observer who is looking at the past? How do we separate the past and the entity who says, “I am looking at it”?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Who is the entity, the observer that is looking at the past? Who is the entity, the thought, the being&mdash;whatever you call it&mdash;who says, “I am looking at the unconscious”?</p>
<p>There is a separation between the observer and the observed. Is that so? Is not the observer the observed? Therefore, there is no separation at all! Go slowly into this. If you could understand this one thing it would be the most extraordinary phenomenon that could take place. Do you understand the question? There is the unconscious as well as the conscious, and I say that I must know all about it; I must know the content and also the state of consciousness when there is no content, which is a step further, which we will go into if we have time.</p>
<p>I am looking at it. I say, the observer says, that the unconscious is the past; the unconscious is the race into which I was born, the tradition&mdash;not only the tradition of society but of the family, the name, the residue of the whole Indian culture, the residue of all of humanity with all its problems, anxieties, guilt, and so on. I am all that, and that is the unconscious, which is the result of time, of many thousands of yesterdays, and there is the ‘me’ who is observing it. Now, who is the observer? Again, find out for yourself; discover who the observer is! Don’t wait for me to tell you!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>The observer is the looker.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But who is the looker? The observer is the observed. Wait, wait! Madam, this is very important. The observer is the observed. There is no difference, which means that the observer is the observed. Then, what can the observer do about the unconscious?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Nothing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, madam, this is really a very important question. You cannot just throw it off and say, “Nothing.” If I am the result of the past and I am the past, I cannot do anything about the unconscious. Do you see what it means? If I cannot do anything about it, I am free of it. Ah, no, no, madam! Don’t agree so quickly; this requires tremendous attention. If I cannot do anything whatsoever, at whatever level it is, about suffering&mdash;physical as well as psychological suffering&mdash;if I cannot do anything about it, because the observer is the observed, then I am totally free of it. It is only when I feel that I can do something about it that I am caught in it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>What happens when I cannot do anything about it? Is not the past the present? The mind is caught in that, and what can it do?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The present is the past, modified, but it is still the past, which is going to create the future, the tomorrow. The past, through the present, is the future. The future is the modified past. We have divided the past into the present and the future, so the past is a perpetual movement, modified, but it is always the past that is functioning. So, there is no present! The past is always operating, though we may call it the present and try to live in the present, try to push away the past or the future and say, “The present is the only existence that matters”; yet it is still the past, which we divide as the present and the future. Now, what happens, the questioner asks, when I realize that the past is me, the observer who is examining the past, when I realize that the observer is the past? What takes place? Who is going to tell you? The speaker? If I were to tell you what takes place, it would be just another conclusion which becomes part of the unconscious. You will function according to what has been said and not discover anything for yourself. All that you are doing when you are waiting for the speaker to tell you is merely accumulating. That accumulation gets modified as the present and the future, and you are perpetually living in the current of time. But when you realize that the observer, the thinker, is the past and therefore there is no division between the observer and the observed, then all activity on the part of the observer ceases, doesn’t it? That is what we don’t realize.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But time is an illusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, no, no! Time is not an illusion. How can you say time is an illusion? You are going to lunch; you have a house, you are going back home; you are going to get on a train, and that journey is going to take five hours or an hour. That is time. It is not an illusion. You cannot translate it as an illusion. It is a fact that the unconscious is the past and the observer says, “I have to empty the past; I have to do something about it; I have to resist it; I have to cleanse it; I have to remove certain neurotic conditions,” and so on and so on. So he, the observer, the actor, looks on it as something different from himself, but when you look at it very closely the actor, the observer, is the unconscious, is the past.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>How is one to empty the past?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You cannot. You empty the past totally when there is no observer. It is the observer who is creating the past; it is the observer who says, “I must do something about it in terms of time.” This is most important. It is very important to understand, when you look at a tree, that there is the tree and there is also you, the observer, looking at it. You who are looking at it have knowledge about that tree. You know what species, what color, what shape, what kind it is, whether it is good. You have knowledge of it, so you are looking at it as an observer who is full of knowledge about it, as you look at your wife or husband with the knowledge of the past, with all the hurts and all the pleasures. You are always looking with both the observer and the thing observed present&mdash;two different states. You never look at a tree; you are always looking with the knowledge of the tree. This is very simple. To look at another&mdash;wife, husband, friend&mdash;demands that you look with a fresh mind; otherwise, you cannot see. If you look with the past, with pleasure, with pain, with anxiety, with what he or she has said to you, that remains; and with all that, through all that, you look. That is the observer. If you can look at a tree or a flower or another human being without the observer, a totally different action takes place.</p>

<p class="subtitle">If the thinker is not understood, obviously his thinking is a process of escape.</p>
<p>What is important, surely, is to be aware without choice, because choice brings about conflict. The chooser is in confusion, therefore he chooses; if he is not in confusion, there is no choice. Only the person who is confused chooses what he shall do or shall not do. The man who is clear and simple does not choose: what is is. Action based on an idea is obviously the action of choice, and such action is not liberating; on the contrary, it only creates further resistance, further conflict, according to that conditioned thinking.</p>
<p>So, then, the important thing is to be aware from moment to moment without accumulating the experience which awareness brings; because, the moment you accumulate, you are aware only according to that accumulation, according to that pattern, according to that experience. That is, your awareness is conditioned by your accumulation, and therefore there is no longer observation, but merely translation. Where there is translation, there is choice, and choice creates conflict; and in conflict there can be no understanding.</p>
<p>As we have been discussing for the last four weeks, the difficulty in understanding ourselves exists because we have never given thought to it. We do not see the importance, the significance, of exploring ourselves directly, not according to any idea, pattern, or teacher. The necessity of understanding ourselves is perceived only when we see that without self-knowledge there can be no basis for thought, for action, for feeling; but self-knowledge is not the outcome of the desire to achieve an end. If we begin to inquire into the process of self-knowledge through fear, through resistance, through authority, or with the desire to gain a result, we shall have what we desire, but it will not be the understanding of the self and the ways of the self. You may place the self at any level, calling it the higher self or the lower self, but it is still the process of thinking; and, if the thinker is not understood, obviously his thinking is a process of escape.</p>
<p>Thought and the thinker are one, but it is thought that creates the thinker, and without thought there is no thinker. So, one has to be aware of the process of conditioning, which is thought; and, when there is awareness of that process without choice, when there is no sense of resistance, when there is neither condemnation nor justification of what is observed, then we see that the mind is the center of conflict. In understanding the mind and the ways of the mind, the conscious as well as the unconscious, through dreams, through every word, through every process of thought and action, the mind becomes extraordinarily quiet; and that tranquillity of the mind is the beginning of wisdom. Wisdom cannot be bought, it cannot be learned; it comes into being only when the mind is quiet, utterly still&mdash;not made still by compulsion, coercion, or discipline. Only when the mind is spontaneously silent is it possible to understand that which is beyond time.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A Different Kind of Learning</p>
<p>I wonder what most of us are seeking. And when we do find what we seek, is it totally satisfactory, or is there always the shadow of frustration in that which we have sought out? And is it possible to learn from everything, from our sorrows and joys, so that our minds are made fresh and are capable of learning infinitely more?</p>
<p>Most of us listen to be told what to do or to conform to a new pattern, or we listen merely to gather further information. If we are here with any such attitude, then the process of listening will have very little significance in what we are trying to do in these talks. And I am afraid most of us are only concerned with that: we want to be told, we are listening in order to be taught, and a mind that merely wants to be told is obviously incapable of learning.</p>
<p>I think there is a process of learning which is not related to wanting to be taught. Being confused, most of us want to find someone who will help us not to be confused, and therefore we are merely learning or acquiring knowledge in order to conform to a particular pattern; and it seems to me that all such forms of learning must invariably lead not only to further confusion but also to deterioration of the mind. I think there is a different kind of learning, a learning which is an inquiry into ourselves and in which there is no teacher and no taught, neither the disciple nor the guru. When you begin to inquire into the operation of your own mind, when you observe your own thinking, your daily activities and feelings, you cannot be taught because there is no one to teach you. You cannot base your inquiry on any authority, on any assumption, on any previous knowledge. If you do, then you are merely conforming to the pattern of what you already know, and therefore you are no longer learning about yourself.</p>
<p>I think it is very important to learn about oneself, because it is only then that the mind can be emptied of the old, and unless the mind is emptied of the old, there can be no new impulse. It is this new, creative impulse that is essential if the individual is to bring about a different world, a different relationship, a different structure of morality. And it is only through totally emptying the mind of the old that the new impulse can come into being, give it whatever name you like&mdash;the impulse of reality, the grace of God&mdash;the feeling of something completely new, unpremeditated, something which has never been thought of, which has not been put together by the mind. Without that extraordinarily creative impulse of reality, do what you will to clear up the confusion and bring order in the social structure, it can only lead to further misery. I think this is fairly obvious when one observes the political and social events that are taking place in the world.</p>
<p>So it is important, it seems to me, that the mind be emptied of all knowledge because knowledge is invariably of the past; and as long as the mind is burdened with the residue of the past, of our personal or collective experiences, there can be no learning.</p>
<p>There is a learning which begins with self-knowledge, a learning which comes with awareness of your everyday activities: what you do, what you think, what your relationship with another is, how your mind responds to every incident and challenge of your daily life. If you are not aware of your response to every challenge in life, there is no selfknowledge. You can know yourself as you are only in relation to something, in relation to people, to ideas, and to things. If you assume anything about yourself, if you postulate that you are the atman, or the higher self, for example, and start from that, which is obviously a form of conclusion, your mind is incapable of learning.</p>
<p>When the mind is burdened with a conclusion, a formulation, there is the cessation of inquiry. And it is essential to inquire, not merely as it is being done by certain specialists in the scientific or psychological field, but to inquire into oneself and to know the totality of one’s being, the operation of one’s own mind at the conscious and also at the unconscious level in all the activities of one’s daily existence: how one functions, what one’s responses are when one goes to the office, rides in the bus, when one talks with one’s children, with one’s wife or husband, and so on. Unless the mind is aware of the totality of itself&mdash;not as it should be, but as it actually is&mdash;unless it is aware of its conclusions, its assumptions, its ideals, its conformity, there is no possibility of the coming into being of this new, creative impulse of reality.</p>
<p>You may know the superficial layers of your mind, but to know the unconscious motives, drives, fears, the hidden residue of tradition, of racial inheritance&mdash;to be aware of all that and to give it close attention is very hard work; it demands a great deal of energy. Most of us are unwilling to give close attention to these things; we have not the patience to go into ourselves step by step, inch by inch, so that we begin to know all the subtleties, the intricate movements of the mind. But it is only the mind which has understood itself in its totality and is therefore incapable of selfdeception, it is only such a mind that can free itself of its past and go beyond its own movements within the field of time. This is not very difficult, but it requires a great deal of hard work.</p>
<p>You work a great deal when you go to the office; you have to work to earn your livelihood, or to do anything else in life. You have been trained to work hard in the commercial world, and you are also willing to work hard in the so-called spiritual world if there is a reward at the end of it. If you are promised a seat in heaven, or if you believe that you can achieve bliss, an everlasting peace, you will work hard to get it, but that is merely an action of greed.</p>
<p>Now, there is a different way of working, which is to inquire into ourselves and to know exactly what is going on within the field of the mind, not in order to gain some reward, but for the very simple reason that there can obviously be no end to misery in the world as long as the mind does not understand itself. And, after all, the world in which we live is not the enormous world of political activities, of scientific research, and so on; it is the little world of the family, the world of relationship between two people at home or in the office, between husband and wife, parents and children, teacher and pupil, lawyer and client, policeman and citizen. That is the little world we all live in, but we want to escape from that world of relationship and go out into an extraordinary world which we have imagined and which does not really exist at all. If we do not understand the world of relationship and bring about a fundamental transformation there, we cannot possibly create a new culture, a different civilization, a peaceful world. So, it must start with ourselves. The world demands an immense, a radical change, but it must begin with you and me; and we cannot bring about a real change in ourselves if we do not know the totality of our world of thoughts, of feelings, of actions, if we are not aware of ourselves from moment to moment. And you will see, if you are so aware, that the mind begins to free itself from all influences of the past. After all, the mind is now the result of the past, and all thinking is a projection of the past, it is simply a response of the past to challenge, so merely to think of creating a new world will never bring a new world into being.</p>
<p>Most people, when they are confused, disturbed, want to return to the past; they seek to revive the old religion, to reestablish the ancient customs, to bring back the form of worship practiced by their ancestors, and all the rest of it. But what is necessary, surely, is to find out whether the mind that is the result of the past, the mind that is confused, disturbed, groping, seeking&mdash;whether such a mind can learn without turning to a guru, whether it can undertake the journey on which there is no guide. Because it is possible to go on this journey only when there is the light which comes through the understanding of yourself, and that light cannot be given to you by another; no Master, no guru can give it to you, nor will you find it in the Gita, or in any other book. You have to find that light within yourself, which means that you must inquire into yourself, and this inquiry is hard work. No one can lead you, no one can teach you how to inquire into yourself. One can point out that such inquiry is essential, but the actual process of inquiring must begin with your own self-observation.</p>
<p>A mind that would understand that which is true, that which is real, that which is good, or that which is beyond the measure of the mind, give it whatever name you like, must be empty, but not be aware that it is empty. I hope you see the difference between the two. If I am aware that I am virtuous, I am no longer virtuous; if I am aware that I am humble, humility has ceased. Surely that is obvious. In the same way, if the mind is aware that it is empty, it is no longer empty because there is always the observer who is experiencing emptiness.</p>
<p>So, is it possible for the mind to be free of the observer, of the censor? After all, the observer, the censor, the watcher, the thinker, is the self, the ‘me’ that is always wanting more and more experience. I have had all the experiences that this world can give me, with its pleasure and pain, its ambition, greed, envy, and I am dissatisfied, frustrated, shallow. So I want further experience on another level which I call the spiritual world, but the experiencer continues, the watcher remains. The watcher, the thinker, the experiencer may cultivate virtue; he may discipline himself and try to lead what he considers to be a moral life, but he remains. And can that experiencer, that self, totally cease? Because only then is it possible for the mind to empty itself and for the new, the truth, the creative reality to come into being.</p>
<p>To put it very simply, is it possible for me to forget myself? Don’t say yes or no. We do not know what it means. The sacred books say so-andso, but all that is mere words, and words are not reality. What is important is for the mind to find out whether that which has been put together&mdash;the experiencer, the thinker, the watcher, the ‘I’&mdash;can disappear, dissolve itself. There must be no other entity who dissolves it. I hope I am making myself clear. If the mind says, “The ‘I’ must be dissolved in order to arrive at that extraordinary state which the sacred books promise,” then there is the action of will; there is an entity who wants to arrive, so the ‘I’ still remains.</p>
<p>Now, is it possible for the mind to free itself of the observer, of the watcher, of the experiencer, without any motive? Obviously, if there is a motive, that very motive is the essence of the ‘me’, of the experiencer. Can you forget yourself entirely without any compulsion, without any desire for reward or fear of punishment, just forget yourself? I do not know if you have tried it. Has such a thought even occurred to you, has it ever come to your mind? And when such a thought does arise, you immediately say, “If I forget myself, how can I live in this world, where everybody is struggling to push me aside and get ahead?” To have a right answer to that question you must first know how to live without the ‘me’, without the experiencer, without the self-centered activity which is the creator of sorrow, the very essence of confusion and misery. So, is it possible, while living in this world with all its complex relationships, with all its travail, to abandon oneself completely and be free of the things which go to make up the ‘me’?</p>
<p>You see, sirs and ladies, this is an inquiry, it is not an answer from me. You will have to find out for yourself, and that requires enormous investigation, hard work&mdash;much harder work than earning a livelihood, which is mere routine. It requires astonishing vigilance, constant watchfulness, a ceaseless inquiry into every movement of thought. And the moment you begin to inquire into the process of thinking, which is to isolate each thought and think it through to the end, you will see how arduous it is; it is not a lazy man’s pleasure. And it is essential to do this because it is only the mind that has emptied itself of all its old recognitions, its old distractions, its conflicts and self-contradictions&mdash;it is only such a mind that has the new, the creative impulse of reality. The mind then creates its own action; it brings into being a different activity altogether, without which mere social reform, however necessary, however beneficial, cannot possibly bring about a peaceful and happy world.</p>
<p>As human beings we are all capable of inquiry, of discovery, and this whole process is meditation. Meditation is inquiry into the very being of the meditator. You cannot meditate without self-knowledge, without being aware of the ways of your own mind, from the superficial responses to the most complex subtleties of thought. I am sure it is not really difficult to know, to be aware of oneself, but it is difficult for most of us because we are so afraid to inquire, to grope, to search out. Our fear is not of the unknown, but of letting go of the known. It is only when the mind allows the known to fade away that there is complete freedom from the known, and only then is it possible for the new impulse to come into being.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Experience hardens into a center, and from this center we act.</p>
<p>Experience nearly always forms a hardened center in the mind, as the self, which is a deteriorating factor. Most of us are seeking experience. We may be tired of the worldly experiences of fame, notoriety, wealth, sex, and so on, but we all want greater, wider experience of some kind, especially those of us who are attempting to reach a so-called spiritual state. Being tired of worldly things, we want a more extensive, a wider, deeper experience; and to arrive at such an experience, we suppress, we control, we dominate ourselves, hoping thereby to achieve a full realization of God, or what you will. We think the pursuit of experience is the right way of life in order to attain greater vision, and I question whether that is so. Does this search for experience, which is really a demand for greater, fuller sensation, lead to reality? Or, is it a factor which cripples the mind?</p>
<p>In our search for sensation, which we call experience, we do various things, do we not? We practice so-called spiritual disciplines: we control, suppress, put ourselves through various forms of religious exercise, all in order to arrive at a greater experience. Some of us have actually done all this, while others only play with the idea. But through it all, the fundamental desire is for greater sensation&mdash;to have the sensation of pleasure extended, made high and permanent, as opposed to the suffering, the dullness, the routine and loneliness of our daily lives. So, the mind is ever seeking experience, and that experience hardens into a center, and from this center we act. We live and have our being in this center, in this accumulated, hardened experience of the past. And, is it possible to live without forming this center of experience and sensation? Because it seems to me that life will then have a significance quite different from that which we now give it. At present we are all concerned, are we not?, with the extension of the center, recruiting greater and wider experience which ever strengthens the self, and I think this invariably limits the mind.</p>
<p>So, is it possible to live in this world without forming this center? I think it is possible only when there is a full awareness of life, an awareness in which there is no motive or choice, but simple observation. I think you will find, if you will experiment with this and think about it a little deeply, that such awareness does not form a center around which experience and the reactions to experience can accumulate. Then the mind becomes astonishingly alive, creative&mdash;and I do not mean writing poems or painting pictures, but a creativeness in which the self is totally absent. I think this is what most of us are really seeking, a state in which there is no conflict, a state of peace and serenity of mind. But this is not possible so long as the mind is the instrument of sensation and is ever demanding further sensation.</p>
<p>After all, most of our memory is based on sensation, either pleasurable or painful; from the painful we try to escape, and to the pleasurable we cling; the one we suppress or seek to avoid, and the other we grope after, hold on to, and think about. So, the center of our experience is essentially based on pleasure and pain, which are sensations, and we are always pursuing experiences which we hope will be permanently satisfying. That is what we are after all the time, and hence there is everlasting conflict. Conflict is never creative; on the contrary, conflict is a most destructive factor, both within the mind itself and in our relationship with the world around us, which is society. If we can understand this really deeply&mdash;that a mind which seeks experience limits itself and is its own source of misery&mdash;then perhaps we can find out what it is to be aware.</p>
<p>Being aware does not mean learning and accumulating lessons from life; on the contrary, to be aware is to be without the scars of accumulated experience. After all, when the mind merely gathers experience according to its own wishes, it remains very shallow, superficial. A mind which is deeply observant does not get caught up in self-centered activities, and the mind is not observant if there is any action of condemnation or comparison. Comparison and condemnation do not bring understanding, rather they block understanding. To be aware is to observe&mdash;just to observe&mdash;without any self-identifying process. Such a mind is free of that hard core which is formed by selfcentered activities.</p>
<p>I think it is very important to experience this state of awareness for oneself, and not merely to know about it through any description which another may give. Awareness comes into being naturally, easily, spontaneously, when we understand the center which is everlastingly seeking experience, sensation. A mind which seeks sensation through experience becomes insensitive, incapable of swift movement, and therefore it is never free. But, in understanding its own self-centered activities, the mind comes upon this state of awareness which is choiceless, and such a mind is then capable of complete silence, stillness.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Can I discover for myself the activities of my ego?</p>
<p>When we are aware of ourselves, is not the whole movement of living a way of uncovering the ‘me’, the ego, the self? The self is a very complex process which can be uncovered only in relationship, in our daily activities, in the way we talk, the way we judge, calculate, the way we condemn others and ourselves. All that reveals the conditioned state of our own thinking; and is it not important to be aware of this whole process? It is only through awareness of what is true from moment to moment that there is discovery of the timeless, the eternal. Without selfknowledge, the eternal cannot be. When we do not know ourselves, the eternal becomes a mere word, a symbol, a speculation, a dogma, a belief, an illusion to which the mind can escape. But, if one begins to understand the ‘me’ in all its various activities from day to day, then in that very understanding, without any effort, the nameless, the timeless, comes into being. But the timeless is not a reward for self-knowledge. That which is eternal cannot be sought after; the mind cannot acquire it. It comes into being when the mind is quiet, and the mind can be quiet only when it is simple, when it is no longer storing up, condemning, judging, weighing. It is only the simple mind that can understand the real, not the mind that is full of words, knowledge, information. The mind that analyses, calculates, is not a simple mind …</p>
<p>So, can I be aware of my greed, of my envy, from moment to moment? These feelings are expressions of the ‘me’, of the self, are they not? The self is still the self at any level you may place it; whether it is the higher self or the lower self, it is still within the field of thought. And can I be aware of these things as they arise from moment to moment? Can I discover for myself the activities of my ego when I am eating, talking at table, when I am playing, when I am listening, when I am with a group of people? Can I be aware of the accumulated resentments, of the desire to impress, to be somebody? Can I discover that I am greedy, and be aware of my condemnation of greed? The very word greed is a condemnation, is it not? To be aware of greed is also to be aware of the desire to be free from it, and to see why one wants to be free from it&mdash;the whole process. This is not a very complicated procedure; one can immediately grasp the whole significance of it. So, one begins to understand from moment to moment this constant growth of the ‘me’, with its self-importance, its self-projected activities&mdash;which is basically, fundamentally, the cause of fear. But you cannot take action to get rid of the cause; all you can do is to be aware of it. The moment you want to be free from the ego, that very desire is also part of the ego, so you have a constant battle in the ego over two desirable things, between the part that wants and the part that does not.</p>
<p>As one becomes aware at the conscious level, one also begins to discover the envy, the struggles, the desires, the motives, the anxieties that lie at the deeper levels of consciousness. When the mind is intent on discovering the whole process of itself, then every incident, every reaction becomes a means of discovery, of knowing oneself. That requires patient watchfulness&mdash;which is not the watchfulness of a mind that is constantly struggling, that is learning how to be watchful. Then you will see that the sleeping hours are as important as the waking hours, because life then is a total process. As long as you do not know yourself, fear will continue and all the illusions that the self creates will flourish.</p>
<p>Self-knowledge, then, is not a process to be read about or speculated upon: it must be discovered by each one from moment to moment, so that the mind becomes extraordinarily alert. In that alertness there is a certain quiescence, a passive awareness in which there is no desire to be or not to be, and in which there is an astonishing sense of freedom. It may be only for a minute, for a second&mdash;that is enough. That freedom is not of memory; it is a living thing, but the mind, having tasted it, reduces it to a memory and then wants more of it. To be aware of this total process is possible only through self-knowledge, and selfknowledge comes into being from moment to moment as we watch our speech, our gestures, the way we talk, and the hidden motives that are suddenly revealed. Then only is it possible to be free from fear. As long as there is fear, there is no love. Fear darkens our being and that fear cannot be washed away by any prayer, by any ideal or activity. The cause of fear is the ‘me’, the ‘me’ which is so complex in its desires, wants, pursuits. The mind has to understand that whole process, and the understanding of it comes only when there is watchfulness without choice.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Expanding consciousness is always within the radius which the center creates.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Can an attempt to revolutionize the psyche also be termed expansion of consciousness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To expand consciousness, there must be a center which is aware of its expansion. The moment there is a center from which you are expanding, it is no longer expansion, because the center always limits its own expansion. If there is a center and I move from that center, though I call it expansion, the center is always fixed. I may expand ten miles, but since the center is always fixed, it is not expansion. It is wrong to use that word expansion.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Doesn’t revolution also imply a center?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, that’s what I carefully explained. Sir, look, let me put it very briefly. You know what space is. When you look at the sky, there is a space, and that space is created by the observer who is looking. There is this object, the microphone, which creates space round itself. Because that object exists, there is space around it. There is this hall, this room. There is space because of the four walls, and there is space outside. We only know space because of the center, which is creating space around himself. Now, he can expand that space by meditation, concentration, and all the rest of it; but the space is always created by the object, like the microphone creates space around itself. As long as there is a center, as the observer, it creates a space round itself; and he may call that space ten thousand miles, or ten steps, but it is still the space restricted by the observer. Expanding consciousness, which is one of the easiest tricks to do, is always within the radius which the center creates. In that space there is no freedom at all because it is like my being free in this room, this hall. I’m not free. There is freedom, and therefore space which is not measurable, only when there is no observer; and the revolution of which we are talking is in the psyche, in the consciousness itself, in which there is now always the center who is talking in terms of ‘me’ and ‘not-me’.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Creative release comes only when the thinker is the thought.</p>
<p>So long as the ‘me’ is the observer, the one who gathers experience, strengthens himself through experience, there can be no radical change, no creative release. That creative release comes only when the thinker is the thought, but the gap cannot be bridged by any effort. When the mind realizes that any speculation, any verbalization, any form of thought only gives strength to the ‘me’, when it sees that as long as the thinker exists apart from thought there must be limitation, the conflict of duality&mdash;when the mind realizes that&mdash;then it is watchful, everlastingly aware of how it is separating itself from experience, asserting itself, seeking power. In that awareness, if the mind pursues it ever more deeply and extensively without seeking an end, a goal, there comes a state in which the thinker and the thought are one. In that state there is no effort, there is no becoming, there is no desire to change; in that state the ‘me’ is not, for there is a transformation which is not of the mind.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The self is always limited.</p>
<p>The self must cease through awareness of its own limitation, the falseness of its own existence.

The mere perception of that fact is the ending of the self, and only then is it possible for that which is the real to come into being.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Is it possible for the mind ever to be free from self-centered activity?</p>
<p>To understand what this self-centered activity is, one must obviously examine it, look at it, be aware of this entire process. If one can be aware of it, then there is the possibility of its dissolution; but to be aware of it requires a certain understanding, a certain intention to face the thing as it is, to look at the thing as it is, and not to interpret it, not to modify it, not to condemn it. We have to be aware of that activity which we are doing from that self-centered state; we must be conscious of it. That is one of our primary difficulties because, the moment we are conscious of that activity, we want to shape it, we want to control it, we want to condemn it, or we want to modify it; but we are never in a position to look at it directly and, when we do, very few of us are capable of knowing what to do.</p>
<p>We realize that self-centered activities are detrimental, are destructive, and that every form of self-centered activity&mdash;such as that of identification with the country, with a particular group, with a particular desire, with desires that produce action, the search for a result here or hereafter, the glorification of an idea, the pursuit of example, worship of virtue and the pursuit of virtue and so on&mdash;is essentially the activity of a self-centered person. All his relationships with nature, with people, with ideas are the outcome of that activity. Knowing all this, what is one to do? All such activity must voluntarily come to an end, not self-imposed, not influenced, not guided. I hope you see the difficulty in this.</p>
<p>Most of us are aware that this self-centered activity creates mischief and chaos, but we are only aware of it in certain directions. Either we observe it in others and are ignorant of our own activities or, being aware, in relationship with others, of our own self-centered activity, we want to transform, we want to find a substitute, we want to go beyond. Before we can deal with it, we must know how this process comes into being, must we not? In order to understand something, we must be capable of looking at it; and to look at it, we must know its various activities at different levels, conscious as well as unconscious, and also the conscious directives, the self-centered movements of the unconscious motives and intentions. Surely, this is a self-centered process, the result of time, is it not?</p>
<p>What is it to be self-centered? When are you conscious of being the ‘me’? As I have suggested often during these talks, don’t merely listen to me verbally but use the words as a mirror in which you see your own mind in operation. If you merely listen to my words, then you are very superficial and your reactions will be very superficial. But if you can listen, not to understand me or what I am saying, but to see yourself in the mirror of my words, if you use me as a mirror in which you discover your own activity, then it will have a tremendous and profound effect. But, if you merely listen as in political or any other talks, then I am afraid you will miss the whole implication of the discovery for yourself of that truth which dissolves the center of the ‘me’.</p>
<p>I am only conscious of this activity of the ‘me’ when I am opposing, when consciousness is thwarted, when the ‘me’ is desirous of achieving a result. The ‘me’ is active, or I am conscious of that center, when pleasure comes to an end and I want to have more of that pleasure; then there is resistance and there is a purposive shaping of the mind to a particular end which will give me a delight, a satisfaction. I am aware of myself and my activities when I am pursuing virtue consciously. That is all we know. A man who pursues virtue consciously is unvirtuous. Humility cannot be pursued, and that is the beauty of humility.</p>
<p>So, as long as this center of activity in any direction, conscious and unconscious, exists, there is this movement of time, and I am conscious of the past and the present in conjunction with the future. The center of this activity, the self-centered activity of the ‘me’ is a time process. That is what you mean by time; you mean the psychological process of time; it is memory that gives continuity to the activity of the center which is the ‘me’. Please watch yourselves in operation, don’t listen to my words or be mesmerized by my words. If you watch yourself and are aware of this center of activity, you will see that it is only the process of time, of memory, of experiencing and translating every experience according to memory. You also see that self-activity is recognition, which is the process of the mind.</p>
<p>Now, can the mind be free from it? That may be possible at rare moments; that may happen to most of us when we do an unconscious, unintentional, unpurposive act. Is it possible for the mind ever to be free from self-centered activity? That is a very important question, first, to put to ourselves because, in the very putting of it, you will find the answer. That is, if you are aware of the total process of this self-centered activity, fully cognizant of its activities at different levels of your consciousness, then surely you have to ask yourselves if it is possible for that activity to come to an end&mdash;that is, not to think in terms of time, not to think in terms of what I will be, what I have been, what I am. From such thought, the whole process of self-centered activity begins; there also begins the determination to become, the determination to choose and to avoid, which are all a process of time. We see, in that process, infinite mischief, misery, confusion, distortion, deterioration taking place. Be aware of it as I am talking, in your relationship, in your mind.</p>
<p>Surely the process of time is not revolutionary. In the process of time, there is no transformation; there is only a continuity and no ending. In the process of time, there is nothing but recognition. Only when you have complete cessation of the time process, of the activity of the self, is there the new, is there revolution, is there transformation.</p>
<p>Being aware of this whole, total process of the ‘me’ in its activity, what is the mind to do? It is only with the renewal, it is only with the revolution&mdash;not through evolution, not through the ‘me’ becoming, but through the ‘me’ completely coming to an end&mdash;there is the new. The time process can’t bring the new; time is not a way of creation.</p>
<p>I do not know if any of you have had a moment of creativity, not action&mdash;I am not talking of putting something into action&mdash;I mean that moment of creation when there is no recognition. At that moment, there is that extraordinary state in which the ‘me’, as an activity through recognition, has ceased. I think some of us have had it, perhaps most of us have had it. If we are aware, we will see in that state that there is no experiencer who remembers, translates, recognizes, and then identifies; there is no thought process which is of time. In that state of creation, creativity, or in that state of the new which is timeless, there is no action of the ‘me’ at all.</p>
<p>We do not have to seek truth. Truth is not something far away. It is the truth of the mind, truth of its activities from moment to moment. If we are aware of this moment-to- moment truth, of this whole process of time, this awareness releases consciousness or that energy to be. As long as the mind uses consciousness as the self-activity, time comes into being with all its miseries, with all its conflicts, with all its mischiefs, its purposive deceptions; and it is only when the mind, understanding this total process, ceases, that love will be. You may call it love or give it some other names; what name you give is of no consequence.</p>

<h1>V. Consciousness, Thought, and Time</h1>
<p class="subtitle">The Field of Consciousness</p>
<p>What we are going to do this evening, if we may, is to learn about this particular thing called consciousness. To learn about consciousness, obviously, you must come to it afresh. You may have read books, you may have ideas, opinions; what you have read, your opinions, your knowledge according to somebody&mdash;all that is not what is, is not the fact. To understand a fact, opinions are not necessary; on the contrary, they are a hindrance. And to inquire into this consciousness, one must be free, not bound to any particular theory or knowledge.</p>
<p>So, the first requirement of a serious human being who wants to learn is that he must be free to inquire, that means, not to be afraid; to be free to look, to observe, to criticize; to be intelligently skeptical, and not to accept opinions. We are going to inquire into something that demands all your attention, and you cannot attend if you have an opinion, an idea, a formula, or knowledge of what other people have said. As we said the other day, if you walk in the light of another, that light will lead you to darkness&mdash;it does not matter who it is that offers the light. But to walk in the light of one’s own understanding, that can only come about when there is attention and silence, and that demands a great deal of seriousness.</p>
<p>So, we have to learn anew about a new way of living. To find that out one has to inquire into this state of mind, into this consciousness, whether it is possible fundamentally&mdash;at the very basis, at the very root&mdash;to change the totality of this consciousness. We mean by consciousness, don’t we?, the thought, the feeling, and the action, conscious or unconscious. That is what we generally mean by consciousness: the whole process of thinking. The senses that create the feeling, the formulas, the concepts, the ideas, the opinion, the belief that there is or that there is not&mdash;all that is within the field of consciousness. And that consciousness is the result of time: time as duration, as years, as a process of evolution. From the thoughtless to the most profound thinking, from the superficial feeling to the great depths of feeling&mdash;all that implies a great stretch of time, not only time by the watch, but also time psychologically, that is, inwardly. Thought is consciousness, thought is time. And this thinking process has taken centuries of experience, knowledge, pain, suffering, and all the rest of it, so that we are able to think.</p>
<p>There is thinking consciously or unconsciously. And the unconscious, as well as the conscious, is still within consciousness, and we divide it for convenience; in fact, there is no such division. Now, all that is the result of centuries of experience, knowledge, information, tradition&mdash;the tradition of the enormous past, or the tradition of a few years or a few days&mdash;the technological influence, the technological knowledge. All that is within that field of consciousness, both the conscious as well as the unconscious. Within that field we act. And within that field there is sorrow, pleasure, pain; there is the conscious sorrow, or the deep, undiscovered, brooding sorrow.</p>
<p>And to bring about a radical change&mdash;that must lie beyond this consciousness, that is, beyond time. But any thought within this field of consciousness is still of time; therefore, we say that to bring about a change radically, we need time, we need a gradual process. Either we say we will change immediately&mdash;still within the field of consciousness&mdash;or we say there will be change in our next life or future life, which also is still within the field of consciousness. So, as long as thought is functioning within that field, thought being time, thought cannot produce a change at all. It can only bring about a modification, a continued modified activity, an adjustment. But within that field there is no possibility of radical change at all. I think this must be very clearly understood between us. Because in that field every action is the result of thought, conscious or unconscious; and that thought creates certain values, and those values are based on pleasure. All our values are based on pleasure. The moral, ethical, so-called noble values are essentially based on pleasure. And, as long as we are functioning and bringing about, or trying to bring about, a change within that field through thought, there is no change at all because thought can only create conflict.</p>
<p>Please do not accept or disagree or deny what is being said. Examine, look at it as though you are looking at it for the first time, if you can. After all, that is the art of listening, isn’t it? Most of us do not listen at all. You hear, but to listen implies attention. And, to attend, every value, opinion, judgment, evaluation, interpretation must be set aside, and then only can you listen to your friend, to your wife, or to anything. So, in the same way, we have to find out how to bring about in the human mind, in the human heart, a total revolution&mdash;not in terms of time, not in terms of evolution.</p>
<p>Thought is the whole machinery of accumulating memory through experience, through knowledge, through various forms of pressures and stresses and influences. That thought cannot under any circumstances bring about a radical revolution. Why can’t it? Because that thought is essentially based on pleasure, and where there is pleasure, there is always pain. All our social, moral, and ethical values are based on pleasure. And our belief&mdash;which is a process of thinking&mdash;in God or no-God, is still the search for comfort, for security psychologically, which is still based on pleasure, and therefore there is always conflict and effort. When there is action in the field of consciousness, as the consciousness is of time, any action within that field is bound to breed conflict and sorrow. So, to bring about a radical revolution in a human being, the radical revolution must be outside the field of consciousness.</p>
<p>Man has lived for two million years or more, but he has not solved the problem of sorrow. He is always sorrow ridden. He has sorrow as his shadow or as his companion: sorrow of losing somebody; sorrow in not being able to fulfill his ambitions, his greed, his energy; sorrow of physical pain; sorrow of psychological anxiety; sorrow of guilt; sorrow of hope and despair. That has been the lot of man, that has been the lot of every human being. And he has always tried to solve this problem&mdash; to end sorrow within the field of consciousness&mdash;by trying to avoid it, by running away from sorrow, by suppressing it, by identifying himself with something greater than himself, by taking to drink, to women, by doing everything in order to avoid this anxiety, this pain, this despair, this immense loneliness and boredom of life, which is always within this field of consciousness which is the result of time.</p>
<p>So, man has always exercised thought as a means to get rid of sorrow by right effort, by right thinking, by living morally, and so on. The exercise of thought has been his game: thought with intellect, and all the rest of it. But thought is the result of time, and time is this consciousness. Whatever you do within the field of this consciousness, sorrow can never end. Whether you go to the temple, or you take to drink, both are the same. So, if there is learning, one sees that through thought there is no possibility of a radical change, but there will be continuity of sorrow. If one sees that, then one can move in a different dimension. I am using the word see in the sense not intellectually, not verbally, but with a total understanding of this fact, the fact that sorrow cannot be ended through thought. This does not mean that you suppress thought. By negating thought, thought merely negates thought, but thought still remains.</p>
<p>To see a fact is one of the most difficult things. It is very simple to see the fact of this microphone&mdash;there it is. You and I have given a particular name to this object, and we say that we both see this microphone, whether it is a good microphone or a bad microphone. But, to look at that tree becomes a little more complex, because when you look at that tree, thought looks at that tree, not your eyes. Observe it, you will see it yourself. Look at a flower. Who is looking? Your eyes? Seeing with eyes means there is no opinion, no thought, no judgment, no naming, but looking. When you say you are looking at a flower, your mind is looking, that is, thought is looking, thought is operating, so you never see the flower. The flower is an objective thing, but if you go inwardly to look at a fact, the inward fact, the true fact of something, it is almost impossible because of all your prejudices, your memories, your experiences, your pleasure, your pain&mdash;all that interferes with your observation. So, sorrow cannot end at any time through thought, thought being the totality of thought and feeling; in that area of consciousness, do what you will, there is no end to sorrow. That is a fact, because man has never been free from that sorrow.</p>
<p>So time, thought, cannot bring about a change. And change in the most profound sense is absolutely necessary because we cannot go on as we are with separatist, narrow, nationalistic, and all other stupidities we have accumulated through centuries, with our gods, with our beliefs, with our rituals, and all that sheer nonsense. Because we do not know what love means. How can we love if there is sorrow in our hearts, in our minds? How can we love if there is competition, greed, envy? We have lived with violence, and we shall go on living with violence unless there is a radical, timeless change. So, if you see the fact that time does not bring about a radical revolution, either outwardly or inwardly, then what takes place?</p>
<p>We need social change, a complete revolution in our relationship between man and man, which has bred this monstrous society. There is violence in our heart, in our relationship. Each person is concerned about himself and not about another. And action invariably breeds conflict; all our life, whatever we are doing, only brings confusion, misery, conflict. Again this is a fact. Whether that action is a conscious action or an unconscious action, it breeds conflict in all our being, whatever we do, because the unconscious is much stronger than the conscious reasoning, conscious, deliberate activity. Please look into yourself deeply, not according to Freud or anybody else, but actually. And, to look at yourself, you must be free to look. If you say, “This is right,” or, “This is wrong,” “This is good,” or, “This is bad,” “I must do this,” or, “I must not do this,” then you are not free to look, to observe, to wander in this extraordinary field of consciousness. So, the unconscious is very strong: it is the racial, communal repository, and that guides much more than the conscious mind. And it has its own motives, its own drives, its own purposes; it gives intimation through dreams and all the rest of it&mdash;I am not going into it now. So, unless there is a radically fundamental revolution, the human conflict will endure forever. Though we may prolong our physical organism indefinitely, though we may have leisure through automation and electronic brains, sorrow and conflict will always exist.</p>
<p>So, what is one to do? Do you understand my question? Is man to live forever in conflict, in sorrow, never knowing what it is to be totally free, and therefore perhaps never knowing what it is to love? When you realize that time, thought, is not the way to end sorrow, then what takes place? Realize&mdash;do you know what we mean by realizing? When you realize that a particular road does not lead to your home, you turn your back on that road and take another road. You do not insist on pursuing that road. If you insist on going on that road which does not lead to your home, mentally there is some imbalance; you are not sane, you are deaf, you are blind, insisting that road will lead to your home. That is exactly what we are doing. We insist that thought, time, evolution, will bring us out of this chaos, misery.</p>
<p>So, knowing that action does inevitably breed sorrow&mdash;as it does in our life&mdash;and that inaction also breeds ugliness and all the rest of it, what is the human being to do? Or, is there anything to be done? You understand my question? We have gone to temples, we have meditated, we have found new ways of prolonging life, and so on, we have done everything we can, we have applied our intelligence, we have committed ourselves to a course of action&mdash;communist, religious, or any other kind of action. And yet there is no freedom, there is no end to sorrow; there is conflict, there is constant effort. Seeing all that, a sane, rational man would say, “That is not the way, I will not pursue that way any more.” It is only when you see very clearly that the road does not lead to your home that you do not go along that road. But to see that is to learn about the totality of thought and feeling, which is consciousness. That is, through thinking, through thought which creates activity of various kinds, through those activities, through those thoughts and feelings, there is no end to conflict, and therefore no end to sorrow. To see that fact, as you would see the fact of this microphone, as you would see the fact of those trees&mdash;it requires attention. And when you attend, your whole consciousness is silent; there is no interference of thought. And that is the way to find out, to learn.</p>
<p>So, is there a dimension beyond and above this consciousness? Don’t jump to the conclusion that it is God; that is silly. A conscious mind thinking about God is still within the limitation of its own consciousness. You understand? If you think about God, your God is the creation of your thinking, and your thinking being the result of time, your God is of time: it has no meaning. Yet we believe, we want to be sane, we want to find truth&mdash;all this through the process of thinking. One can ask the question whether there is a different dimension. It is not a theoretical question but a valid question, a fundamental question, only when one has understood the nature of time. You understand?</p>
<p>Look, sir! The world is exploding in population. Go down the street and watch the millions&mdash;uneducated, backward, superstitious and all the rest of it. And compassion, sympathy, says, “They will have another chance, next life; they will evolve as you evolve.” We all believe in that. We do not want to think that our life has been lived in confusion, and that we would go down the gutter as so many people have done, like so many fish thrown away. We say only a few can realize this extraordinary freedom outside consciousness. So, we invent, or we hope that there is, evolution&mdash;that is, gradually man will become more and more free, more and more loving, kind, nonviolent, and all the rest of it. The moment you admit time, you admit the continuity of sorrow. If you do not have time, then what hope have you, knowing that you are old, you are so heavily conditioned that you can hardly break your habits, even the most trivial habit. We have to break our habits instantly&mdash;not tomorrow&mdash;not only the superficial habits, but the deeper habits, the ways of thinking, the ways of our beliefs, dogmas. We have to break deep-rooted habits; therefore, we say, “They cannot be broken immediately; we must have time.” Therefore, we say that we will do it next life or next week, which is the same thing, which is to admit time.</p>
<p>So, from this one inevitably asks: Is there an action which is not of time&mdash;an action in this world, living in today&mdash;without all this confusion, chaos, miseries, quarrels, dirt, superstition, and the ugly gods? Can I, can you, caught in time, break through the net of time? And it must be done immediately, instantly; otherwise, you have the hope of evolution, gradualness, and therefore you will gradually get rid of sorrow. And sorrow can never be got rid of, put aside, through time. So, there must be an instant action&mdash;and there is an instant action&mdash; which breaks this net of time. You will say, “What am I to do? Tell me what to do. What practice? What method? How am I to think, to break this tremendous burden of time?” These questions indicate that you are still thinking in terms of time: practice implies time, method implies time, to wait for somebody to tell you what to do implies time. And your doing it according to what has been said is within the field of time; therefore, within that field of time, there is no hope; there is only despair and mounting sorrow.</p>
<p>So, you have to see the truth of it. Seeing the truth of it is meditation&mdash;which we will discuss another time. You can see the truth of it only when you are completely attentive with all your being. And you cannot be attentive if there is no silence. It is only in that silence, which is not to be achieved through time, and through that attention that there is the end of sorrow. Then one sees that there is a different dimension altogether&mdash;not the dimension of gods or all the stupid nonsense which man has invented out of his fear, out of his despair. There is a dimension of action which does not create conflict and contradiction and therefore effort. But the mind cannot come to it, do what it will, unless it understands the whole field of consciousness, which is time. And that can be understood, not through time, not through thought, but by instant awareness, by instant perception.</p>
<p>Sirs, you have to be serious enough, earnest enough, to watch the whole movement of thought as consciousness, the whole movement of thought as a river that is flowing: the great weight of knowledge, tradition, hope, despair, anxiety, and the misery behind thought. And you have to watch all this completely, not as the watcher and the thing watched. The thinker is the thought; the observer is the observed. If you look at a tree, if you look at the beauty of the sky and the loveliness of a still night, you&mdash;the center&mdash;remain, and therefore you are the observer. The observer creates round himself space, and in that space he experiences that which is experienceable. That is, if you observe as an observer, then you are always creating the thing which is observed. If there is no observer as the center from which he is looking, there is only the fact.</p>
<p>Listen to those crows. Do listen. If you listen completely, is there a center from which you are listening? Your ears are listening. There is the noise, there is the vibration and all the rest of it, but there is no center from which you are listening. There is attention. Therefore, if you listen completely, there is no listener; there is only the fact of that noise. To listen completely you must be silent, and that silence is not something in thought, created by thought. When you listen to that crow that is making the noise before it goes to sleep, so completely that there is no listener, you will see that there is no entity that says, “I am listening.”</p>
<p>So, the thinker and the thought are one; without thought there is no thinker. And, when there is no thinker and only thought, then there is an awareness of thinking without thought, and thought comes to an end. Please do not practice all this. Do not sit in posture, breathe right, hold your nose, stand on your head, or do whatever you do. It is all so infantile, so immature. This requires great maturity. Maturity means sensitivity, intelligence. And you cannot be attentive if you are not completely sensitive; your body, your nerves, your mind, your heart, everything being completely alert, not made dull. Then, you will&mdash;not that you will find it, you will never find it&mdash;the thinker, which is you, will never find reality.</p>
<p>This fact has to be seen: that there is a dimension of action which does not breed conflict or sorrow. And, to find it, to come upon it darkly, mysteriously, without thinking, there must be freedom right from the beginning, not at the end&mdash;freedom to investigate, to look, to observe, freedom from fear.</p>

<p class="subtitle">No solution of any kind, however clever, however well thought out, can ever put an end to the conflict between man and man, between you and me.</p>
<p>Thought has not solved our problems, and I don’t think it ever will. We have relied on the intellect to show us the way out of our complexity. The more cunning, the more hideous, the more subtle the intellect is, the greater the variety of systems, of theories, of ideas. And ideas do not solve any of our human problems; they never have and they never will. The mind is not the solution; the way of thought is obviously not the way out of our difficulty. It seems to me that we should first understand this process of thinking, and perhaps be able to go beyond. For, when thought ceases, perhaps we shall be able to find a way which will help us to solve our problems, not only the individual but also the collective.</p>
<p>Thinking has not solved our problems. The clever ones, the philosophers, the scholars, the political leaders, have not really solved any of our human problems&mdash;which are the relationship between you and another, between you and myself. So far we have used the mind, the intellect, to help us investigate the problem and thereby are hoping to find a solution. Can thought ever dissolve our problems? Is not thought, unless it is in the laboratory or on the drawing-board, always selfprotecting, self-perpetuating, conditioned? Is not its activity self-centered? And can such thought ever resolve any of the problems which thought itself has created? Can the mind, which has created the problems, resolve those things that it has itself brought forth?</p>
<p>Surely, thinking is a reaction. If I ask you a question, you respond to it: you respond according to your memory, to your prejudices, to your upbringing, to the climate, to the whole background of your conditioning; you reply accordingly, you think accordingly. The center of this background is the ‘me’ in the process of action. So long as that background is not understood, so long as that thought process, that self which creates the problem, is not understood and put an end to, we are bound to have conflict, within and without, in thought, in emotion, in action. No solution of any kind, however clever, however well thought out, can ever put an end to the conflict between man and man, between you and me. Realizing this, being aware of how thought springs up and from what source, then we ask, “Can thought ever come to an end?”</p>
<p>That is one of the problems, is it not? Can thought resolve our problems? By thinking over the problem, have you resolved it? Any kind of problem&mdash;economic, social, religious&mdash;has it ever been really solved by thinking? In your daily life, the more you think about a problem, the more complex, the more irresolute, the more uncertain it becomes. Is that not so&mdash;in our actual, daily life? You may, in thinking out certain facets of the problem, see more clearly another person’s point of view, but thought cannot see the completeness and fullness of the problem; it can only see partially, and a partial answer is not a complete answer, therefore it is not a solution.</p>
<p>The more we think over a problem, the more we investigate, analyze, and discuss it, the more complex it becomes. So, is it possible to look at the problem comprehensively, wholly? How is this possible? Because that, it seems to me, is our major difficulty. Our problems are being multiplied&mdash;there is imminent danger of war, there is every kind of disturbance in our relationships&mdash;and how can we understand all that comprehensively, as a whole? Obviously, it can be solved only when we can look at it as a whole&mdash;not in compartments, not divided. When is that possible? Surely, it is only possible when the process of thinking&mdash;which has its source in the ‘me’, the self, in the background of tradition, of conditioning, of prejudice, of hope, of despair&mdash;has come to an end. Can we understand this self, not by analyzing, but by seeing the thing as it is, being aware of it as a fact and not as a theory&mdash; not seeking to dissolve the self in order to achieve a result but seeing the activity of the self, the ‘me’, constantly in action? Can we look at it, without any movement to destroy or to encourage? That is the problem, is it not? If, in each one of us, the center of the ‘me’ is non-existent, with its desire for power, position, authority, continuance, selfpreservation, surely our problems will come to an end.</p>
<p>The self is a problem that thought cannot resolve. There must be an awareness which is not of thought. To be aware, without condemnation or justification, of the activities of the self&mdash;just to be aware&mdash;is sufficient.</p>

<p class="subtitle">There is a stillness which is not induced, a stillness in which the mind is no longer using thought to revive itself.</p>
<p>The mind, both conscious and unconscious, is a bundle of memories, and when the mind says to itself, “I must be free of memory in order to understand reality,” that very wish to be free is part of memory. That is a fact. Therefore, the mind no longer wishes to be anything: it merely faces the fact that it itself is memory; it does not wish to transform, it does not wish to become something else. When the mind sees that any action on its own part is still the functioning of memory, and therefore that it is incapable of finding truth, what then is the state of the mind? It becomes still. When the mind perceives that any activity of its own is futile, is all part of memory and therefore of time, seeing that fact, it stops, does it not? If your mind sees the reality of what I am saying, that whatever it does is still part of memory, and therefore it cannot act to be free of memory, it does not act. When mind sees that it cannot proceed that way, it stops. Therefore, the mind&mdash;the whole content of the mind, the conscious and the unconscious&mdash; becomes still. Now the mind is without action, it has seen that whatever it does is on a horizontal line, which is memory; therefore, seeing the fallacy of that, it becomes quiet. It has no object in view, it has no desire for a result, it is absolutely tranquil, without movement in any direction. Therefore, what has happened? The mind is tranquil, it has not been made tranquil. See the difference between a mind that is put to sleep and a mind that is quiet. In that state you will find an enormous movement, extreme vitality, a newness, peaceful and alert. All positive action has ceased, and the mind is in a state of the highest intelligence because it has approached the problem of memory through negative thinking, which is the highest form of thinking. So, the mind is peaceful, swift, and yet still; it is not exclusive, it is not concentrating or focusing, but is extensively aware. Now what happens? In that awareness there is no choice, but merely seeing things as they are&mdash;red as red, blue as blue&mdash;without any distortion. In that state which is peaceful, choicelessly aware, and alert, you will find that all verbalization, all mentation or intellection has completely stopped. There is a stillness which is not induced, a stillness in which the mind is no longer using thought to revive itself; therefore, there is neither the thinker nor the thought. There is neither the experiencer nor the experienced, because the experiencer and the experienced come into being through the thought process, and the thought process has entirely stopped. There is only a state of experiencing. In that state of experiencing, there is no time; all time as yesterday, today, and tomorrow has completely stopped. If you can go further into it, you will see that the mind which was the product of time has completely transformed itself and is now without time; and that which is without time is eternal, that which is without time is immeasurable, it has no beginning and no end, it is without cause and therefore without effect&mdash;and that which is without cause is the real. You can experience that now, but not through centuries of practice, discipline, or control. It must be now or never.</p>

<p class="q"><b><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Can there be thinking without memory?</b></p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In other words, is there thought without the word? You know, it is very interesting, if you go into it. Is the speaker using thought? Thought, as the word, is necessary for communication, is it not? The speaker has to use words, English words, to communicate with you who understand English. And the words come out of memory, obviously. But what is the source, what is behind the word? Let me put it differently.</p>
<p>There is a drum; it gives out a tone. When the skin is tightly stretched at the right tension, you strike it, and it gives out the right tone, which you may recognize. The drum, which is empty, in right tension, is as your own mind can be. When there is right attention and you ask the right question, then it gives the right answer. The answer may be in terms of the word, the recognizable, but that which comes out of that emptiness is, surely, creation. The thing that is created out of knowledge is mechanical, but the thing which comes out of emptiness, out of the unknown, that is the state of creation.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Without being aware and experiencing the ways of thought, love cannot be.</p>
<p>Thought, with its emotional and sensational content, is not love. Thought invariably denies love. Thought is founded on memory, and love is not memory. When you think about someone you love, that thought is not love. You may recall a friend’s habits, manners, idiosyncrasies, and think of pleasant or unpleasant incidents in your relationship with that person, but the pictures which thought evokes are not love. By its very nature, thought is separative. The sense of time and space, of separation and sorrow, is born of the process of thought, and it is only when the thought process ceases that there can be love.</p>
<p>Thought inevitably breeds the feeling of ownership, that possessiveness which consciously or unconsciously cultivates jealousy. Where jealousy is, obviously love is not; and yet with most people, jealousy is taken as an indication of love. Jealousy is the result of thought, it is a response of the emotional content of thought. When the feeling of possessing or being possessed is blocked, there is such emptiness that envy takes the place of love. It is because thought plays the role of love that all the complications and sorrows arise.</p>
<p>If you did not think of another, you would say that you did not love that person. But is it love when you do think of the person? If you did not think of a friend whom you think you love, you would be rather horrified, would you not? If you did not think of a friend who is dead, you would consider yourself disloyal, without love, and so on. You would regard such a state as callous, indifferent, and so you would begin to think of that person, you would have photographs, images made by the hand or by the mind; but thus to fill your heart with the things of the mind is to leave no room for love. When you are with a friend, you do not think about him; it is only in his absence that thought begins to re-create scenes and experiences that are dead. This revival of the past is called love. So, for most of us, love is death, a denial of life; we live with the past, with the dead; therefore, we ourselves are dead, though we call it love.</p>
<p>The process of thought ever denies love. It is thought that has emotional complications, not love. Thought is the greatest hindrance to love. Thought creates a division between what is and what should be, and on this division morality is based; but neither the moral nor the immoral know love. This moral structure, created by the mind to hold social relationships together, is not love, but a hardening process like that of cement. Thought does not lead to love, thought does not cultivate love, for love cannot be cultivated as a plant in the garden. The very desire to cultivate love is the action of thought.</p>
<p>If you are at all aware, you will see what an important part thought plays in your life. Thought obviously has its place, but it is in no way related to love. What is related to thought can be understood by thought, but that which is not related to thought cannot be caught by the mind. You will ask, then what is love? Love is a state of being in which thought is not; but the very definition of love is a process of thought, and so it is not love.</p>
<p>We have to understand thought itself, and not try to capture love by thought. The denial of thought does not bring about love. There is freedom from thought only when its deep significance is fully understood; and, for this, profound self-knowledge is essential, not vain and superficial assertions. Meditation and not repetition, awareness and not definition, reveal the ways of thought. Without being aware and experiencing the ways of thought, love cannot be.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Forget the ideal, and be aware of what you are.</p>
<p>Like most people, you have ideals, have you not? And the ideal is not real, not factual; it is what should be, it is something in the future. Now, what I say is this: forget the ideal, and be aware of what you are. Do not pursue what should be, but understand what is. The understanding of what you actually are is far more important than the pursuit of what you should be. Why? Because, in understanding what you are, there begins a spontaneous process of transformation; whereas, in becoming what you think you should be, there is no change at all, but only a continuation of the same old thing in a different form. If the mind, seeing that it is stupid, tries to change its stupidity into intelligence, which is what should be, that is silly, it has no meaning, no reality; it is only the pursuit of a self-projection, a postponement of the understanding of what is. As long as the mind tries to change its stupidity into something else, it remains stupid. But if the mind says, “I realize that I am stupid and I want to understand what stupidity is, therefore I shall go into it, I shall observe how it comes into being,” then that very process of inquiry brings about a fundamental transformation.</p>

<p class="subtitle">An ideal is merely a distraction.</p>
<p>To understand something, I must give it full attention, and an ideal is merely a distraction which prevents my giving that feeling or that quality full attention at a given time. If I am fully aware, if I give my full attention to the quality I call greed without the distraction of an ideal, then am I not in a position to understand greed and so dissolve it? You see, we are so accustomed to postponement, and ideals help us to postpone; but if we can put away all ideals&mdash;because we understand the escapes, the postponing quality of an ideal&mdash;and face the thing as it is, directly, immediately, give our full attention to it, then, surely, there is a possibility of transforming it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">To understand the actual requires awareness, a very alert, swift mind.</p>
<p>The what is is what you are, not what you would like to be; it is not the ideal because the ideal is fictitious, but it is actually what you are doing, thinking, and feeling from moment to moment. What is is the actual, and to understand the actual requires awareness, a very alert, swift mind. But if we begin to condemn what is, if we begin to blame or resist it, then we shall not understand its movement. If I want to understand somebody, I cannot condemn him&mdash;I must observe, study him. I must love the very thing I am studying. If you want to understand a child, you must love and not condemn him. You must play with him, watch his movements, his idiosyncrasies, his ways of behavior; but if you merely condemn, resist, or blame him, there is no comprehension of the child. Similarly, to understand what is, one must observe what one thinks, feels, and does from moment to moment. That is the actual. Any other action, any ideal or ideological action is not the actual&mdash;it is merely a wish, a fictitious desire to be something other than what is.</p>
<p>So, to understand what is requires a state of mind in which there is no identification or condemnation, which means a mind that is alert and yet passive....</p>

<p class="subtitle">Can a conflict be overcome in a period of time?</p>
<p>Now, the next question is whether transformation is a matter of time. Most of us are accustomed to think that time is necessary for transformation: I am something, and to change what I am into what I should be requires time... When we use time as a means of acquiring a quality, a virtue, or a state of being, we are merely postponing or avoiding what is; and I think it is important to understand this point. Greed or violence causes pain, disturbance, in the world of our relationship with another, which is society; and, being conscious of this state of disturbance, which we term greed or violence, we say to ourselves, “I will get out of it in time. I will practice nonviolence, I will practice non-envy, I will practice peace.” Now, you want to practice nonviolence because violence is a state of disturbance, conflict, and you think that in time you will gain nonviolence and overcome the conflict. So, what is actually happening? Being in a state of conflict, you want to achieve a state in which there is no conflict. Now, is that state of no conflict the result of time, of a duration? Obviously not. Because, while you are achieving a state of nonviolence, you are still being violent and are therefore still in conflict.</p>
<p>So, our problem is: can a conflict, a disturbance, be overcome in a period of time, whether it be days, years, or lives? What happens when you say, “I am going to practice nonviolence during a certain period of time?” The very practice indicates that you are in conflict, does it not? You would not practice if you were not resisting conflict, and you say the resistance to conflict is necessary in order to overcome conflict, and for that resistance you must have time. But the very resistance to conflict is itself a form of conflict. You are spending your energy in resisting conflict in the form of what you call greed, envy, or violence, but your mind is still in conflict. So, it is important to see the falseness of the process of depending on time as a means of overcoming violence, and thereby be free of that process. Then you are able to be what you are.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The moment the mind demands more, it must of necessity create time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You seem to question the validity of time as a means to the attainment of perfection. What, then, is your way?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, the very idea of the attainment of perfection and the way to it implies time, and in wanting to know what my way to it is, the questioner is still thinking in terms of time. Sir, there may be no way at all. Let us go into it.</p>
<p>What do we mean by time? Let us think about it, not philosophically, but very simply, quietly, easily. There is obviously chronological time: I must have time to catch a train, time to go from here to where I live, time to receive a letter, time to talk, time to tell you a story, time to write a poem or carve an image out of marble. But is there any other form of time? You say there is, because there is memory. If I had a certain experience yesterday which gave delight, it has left a memory, and I want more of that delight. So the more is time in the psychological sense: I must have time to fulfill, to achieve, to gather, to become; I must have time to bridge the gap between myself who am not perfect and that which is perfect over there, the over there being in my mind. So, there is space in my mind, a distance between what is and what should be, the perfect ideal. There is a fixed point as the ‘me’, and a fixed point as the ‘non-me’ which I call perfection, the higher self, God, or what you will, and to move from this fixed point as the ‘me’ to that fixed point as the ‘non-me’, I need time. So, the mind has not only the chronological time which is necessary to catch a train or keep an appointment, but also psychological time: time to fulfill, to achieve. If I am ambitious, I must have time to attain, to become famous, and so on, and in the same way we think of perfection. Having divided itself as the imperfect, the mind conceives a state of perfection and establishes the distance between itself and that state; and then it says, “How am I to get from here to there?” Do you understand, sirs?</p>
<p>I am miserable, and I think I must have time to become perfect, to find happiness&mdash;if not in this life, then in some future life&mdash;but the mind is still within the field of time, however much that field may be extended or narrowed down. All your sacred books, all your religions say that you need time to become perfect, and that you must take a vow of celibacy, of poverty, you must resist temptation, discipline, control yourself in order to get there. So, the mind has invented time as a means to perfection, to God, to truth, and it thinks in those terms because in the meantime it can be greedy, brutal, saying that it will polish itself up and eventually become perfect. I say that way is totally wrong, it is no way at all. It is merely an escape. A mind that is caught in perfection, in struggle, can only conceive of what perfection is, and that which it conceives out of its confusion, its misery, is not perfection, it is only a wish.</p>
<p>So, in its effort to be that which it thinks it should be, the mind is not approaching perfection, it is merely escaping from what is, from the fact that it is violent, greedy. Perfection may not be a fixed point, it may be something totally different. As long as the mind has a fixed point from which it moves, acts, it must think in terms of time, and whatever it projects, however noble, however idealistically perfect, is still within the field of time. All its speculations on what Krishna, Buddha, Shankara, or anyone else has said, all its imaginations, its desires for perfection, are still within the field of time, therefore utterly false, valueless. A mind with a fixed point can only think in terms of other fixed points, and it creates the distance between itself and the fixed point which it calls perfection. Though you may wish otherwise, there may be no fixed points at all. In actuality, there is not any fixed ‘you’ or fixed ‘me’, is there? The ‘I’, the self, is made up of many qualities, experiences, conditionings, desires, fears, loves, hates, various masks. There is no fixed point, but the mind abhors this fact; therefore, it moves from one fixed point to another, carrying the burden of the known to the known.</p>
<p>So, time is an illusion when we think in terms of perfection. Desire has time, sensation has time, but love has no time. Love is a state of being. To love completely, simply, without either seeking or rejecting, is not to think in terms of perfection or of becoming perfect. But we do not know such love; therefore, we say, “I must have something else, I must have time to reach perfection.” We discipline ourselves, we gather virtues, and if we don’t sufficiently gather in this life, there is always the next life, so this movement of backwards and forwards is set going.</p>
<p>When you think in terms of time, you are really pursuing the more, are you not? You want more love, more goodness, more pleasure, more ways of avoiding pain, more of the experience which delights, which brings a fleeting happiness; and the moment the mind demands more, it must have time, it must of necessity create time. This demand for the more is an escape from the actual. When the mind says, “I must be more clever,” that very assertion implies time. But if the mind can look at what is without condemnation, without comparison, if it can just observe the fact, then in that awareness there is no fixed point. As in the universe there is no fixed point, so in us there is no fixed point. But the mind likes to have a fixed point, so it creates a fixed point in name, in property, in money, in virtue, in relationships, in ideals, beliefs, dogmas; it becomes the embodiment of its own inventions, its own desires: the mind’s idea of perfection is itself made more peaceful, made more noble, quiet. But perfection is not the opposite of what is. Perfection is that state of mind in which all comparison has ceased. There is no thinking in terms of the more, therefore no struggle. If you can just know the truth of that, if you can merely listen and find it out for yourself, then you will see that you are free from time altogether. Then creation is from moment to moment, without accumulation of the moment, because creation is truth, and truth has no continuity. You think of truth as continuous in time, but truth is not continuous, it is not a permanent thing to be known in time. It is nothing of that kind, it is something totally different, something that cannot be understood by a mind that is caught within the field of time. You must die to everything of yesterday, to all the accumulations of knowledge, experience, and only then that which is immeasurable, timeless, comes into being.</p>

<p class="subtitle">To discover what is beyond time, thought must come to an end.</p>
<p>It is the mind, it is thought, that creates time. Thought is time, and whatever thought projects must be of time; therefore, thought cannot possibly go beyond itself. To discover what is beyond time, thought must come to an end&mdash;and that is a most difficult thing because the ending of thought does not come about through discipline, through control, through denial or suppression. Thought ends only when we understand the whole process of thinking and, to understand thinking, there must be self-knowledge. Thought is the self, thought is the word which identifies itself as the ‘me’, and at whatever level, high or low, the self is placed, it is still within the field of thought … And the self is very complex; it is not at any one level but is made up of many thoughts, many entities, each in contradiction with the other. There must be a constant awareness of them all, an awareness in which there is no choice, no condemnation or comparison, that is, there must be the capacity to see things as they are without distorting or translating them. The moment we judge or translate what is seen, we distort it according to our background … To be is to be related, and it is only in the midst of relationship that we can spontaneously discover ourselves as we are. It is this very discovery of ourselves as we are, without any sense of condemnation or justification, that brings about a fundamental transformation in what we are&mdash;and that is the beginning of wisdom.</p>

<p class="subtitle">If you can really understand this, then the seed of that radical revolution has already been planted.</p>
<p>Change comes into being when there is no fear, when there is neither the experiencer nor the experience; it is only then that there is the revolution which is beyond time. But that cannot be as long as I am trying to change the ‘I’, as long as I am trying to change what is into something else. I am the result of all the social and the spiritual compulsions, persuasions, and all the conditioning based on acquisitiveness&mdash;my thinking is based on that. To be free from that conditioning, from that acquisitiveness, I say to myself, “I must not be acquisitive; I must practice nonacquisitiveness.” But such action is still within the field of time, it is still the activity of the mind. Just see that. Don’t say, “How am I to get to that state when I am nonacquisitive?” That is not important. It is not important to be nonacquisitive; what is important is to understand that the mind which is trying to get away from one state to another is still functioning within the field of time, and therefore there is no revolution, there is no change. If you can really understand this, then the seed of that radical revolution has already been planted and that will operate: you have not a thing to do.</p>

<h1>VI. Awareness and Transformation</h1>
<p>The very awareness of what is is a liberative process. So long as we are unaware of what we are and are trying to become something else, so long will there be distortion and pain. The very awareness of what I am brings about transformation and the freedom of understanding.</p>

<h3>Transformation and the Energy to Change</h3>
<p>As long as you are looking for transformation, a result to be gained, there will be no transformation. As long as you are thinking in terms of achievement, in terms of time, there can be no transformation, for then the mind is caught in the net of time. When you say you are thinking in terms of immediate transformation, you are thinking of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Such transformation within time is merely change, which is modified continuity. When thought is free of time, there will be a timeless transformation.</p>
<p>As long as a problem is thought about, the problem will continue. Thought creates the problem. That which is the result of the past, the mind, cannot solve the problem. The mind can analyze, can examine, but it cannot resolve the problem. The problem, however complex and however close, ceases only when the thought process comes to an end. When the mind, which is the result of many yesterdays, with its reasons and calculations, ceases, then only the problem comes to an end. That which is the result of time cannot bring about transformation; it can and will bring about a change, which is modified continuity or rearrangement of a pattern, but such action does not bring about freedom.</p>
<p>What do we mean by transformation? Surely, the cessation of all problems, cessation from conflict, confusion, and misery. If you observe, you will see that the mind is cultivating, sowing, and harvesting as a farmer cultivates, sows, and reaps. But, unlike the farmer who allows the field to lie fallow during winter, the mind never allows itself to lie fallow. As the rains, the storms, and the sunshine recreate the earth, so during that passive yet alert fallowness of the mind, there is rejuvenation, a renewal, so the mind renews itself and the problems are resolved. The problems are resolved only when they are seen clearly and swiftly.</p>
<p>The mind is constantly distracted, escaping, because to see a problem clearly might lead to action which might create further disturbance; and so the mind is constantly avoiding facing the problem, which only gives strength to the problem. But, when it is seen clearly without distortion, then it ceases to be. So long as you think in terms of transformation, there cannot be transformation, now or hereafter. Transformation can come only when every problem is immediately understood. You can understand it when there is no choice and the seeking of a result, when there is no condemnation or justification. Where there is love, there is neither choice nor search for an end, nor condemnation, nor justification. It is this love that brings about transformation.</p>

<p class="subtitle">We must be aware of how we dissipate energy.</p>
<p>To bring about a good society, human beings have to change. You and I must find the energy, the impetus, the vitality to bring about this radical transformation of the mind, and that is not possible if we do not have enough energy. We need a great deal of energy to bring about a change within ourselves, but we waste our energy through conflict, through resistance, through conformity, through acceptance, through obedience. It is a waste of energy when we are trying to conform to a pattern. To conserve energy we must be aware of ourselves, how we dissipate energy. This is an age-long problem because most human beings are indolent; they would rather accept, obey, and follow. If we become aware of this indolence, this deep-rooted laziness, and try to quicken the mind and the heart, the intensity of it again becomes a conflict, which is also a waste of energy.</p>
<p>Our problem, one of the many that we have, is how to conserve this energy, the energy that is necessary for an explosion to take place in consciousness: an explosion that is not contrived, that is not put together by thought, but an explosion that occurs naturally when this energy is not wasted. Conflict in any form, at any level, at any depth of our being, is a waste of energy.</p>

<p class="subtitle">In facing a fact there is a release of energy.</p>
<p>Why should not jealousy, ambition, etc. be immediately brushed aside? Why should there be this postponement, the gradual change, the acceptance of idealistic authority? I hope, sirs, you are thinking it out with me and not merely listening to me. We accept this gradual process of change because it is more easy, and postponement is more pleasurable. The immediate gives you a great deal of excitement, and to see its value is much more difficult and requires much greater attention and energy. I do not know if you have realized that in facing a fact there is a release of energy, and it is this facing the fact, from which energy is derived, which has the quality that brings about mutation. And we cannot face the fact if we are convinced that change through a gradual process, through influence, through fear, through compulsion, is the only way. In the very act of facing it, you will find there is release of energy, psychologically.</p>
<p>Most of our lives are wasted through conflict. We do not face facts but run away from them, seeking various forms of escape. This is dissipated energy, and the result of that dissipation is confusion. If one does not escape, if one does not translate the fact in terms of one’s own pleasure and pain, but merely observes, then that act of pure seeing in which there is no resistance is the releasing of energy.</p>

<p class="subtitle">To awaken this energy, the mind must have no resistance, no motive, no end in view, and it must not be caught in time.</p>
<p>Now, how do we awaken in ourselves an energy that has its own momentum, that is its own cause and effect, an energy that has no resistance and does not deteriorate? How does one come by it? The organized religions have advocated various methods, and by practicing a particular method one is supposed to get this energy. But methods do not give this energy. The practice of a method implies conformity, resistance, denial, acceptance, adjustment, so that whatever energy one has is merely wearing itself out. If you see the truth of this, you will never practice any method. That is one thing. Secondly, if energy has a motive, an end towards which it is going, that energy is self-destructive. And for most of us, energy does have a motive, does it not? We are moved by a desire to achieve, to become this or that, and therefore our energy defeats itself. Thirdly, energy is made feeble, petty, when it is conforming to the past&mdash;and this is perhaps our greatest difficulty. The past is not only the many yesterdays but also every minute that is being accumulated, the memory of the thing that was over a second before. This accumulation in the mind is also destructive of energy.</p>
<p>So, to awaken this energy, the mind must have no resistance, no motive, no end in view, and it must not be caught in time as yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Then energy is constantly renewing itself and therefore not degenerating. Such a mind is not committed, it is completely free, and it is only such a mind that can find the unnameable, that extraordinary something which is beyond words. The mind must free itself from the known to enter into the unknown.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Mirror of Relationship</p>
<p>To see in the mirror of our relationship exactly what is taking place, there must be choiceless awareness; and, in the very perception of what is, there is freedom from what is.</p>
<p class="right">Seattle, 5th Public Talk, August 13, 1950<br /><i>Collected Works, Vol. VI</i>, p. 240</p>


<hr class="separator">


<p class="subtitle">It is only when the fundamental process of thinking is uncovered through awareness in relationship that it is possible to understand and be free.</p>
<p>Most of us are trapped, whether we like it or not, because that is our world, that is our society; and awareness in relationship is the mirror in which we can see ourselves very clearly. To see clearly, there must obviously be no condemnation, acceptance, justification, or identification. If we are simply aware without choice, then we can observe not only the superficial reactions of the mind, but also the deep and hidden reactions, which come out in the shape of dreams, or in moments when the superficial mind is quiet and there is spontaneity of response. But if the mind is conditioned, shaped, and bound by a particular belief, surely there can be no spontaneity, and therefore no direct perception of the responses of relationship.</p>
<p>It is important to see, is it not?, that no one can give us freedom from the conflict of relationship. We can hide behind the screen of words, or follow a teacher, or run to a church, or lose ourselves in a cinema or a book, or keep on attending talks; but it is only when the fundamental process of thinking is uncovered through awareness in relationship that it is possible to understand and be free of that friction which we instinctively seek to avoid. Most of us use relationship as a means of escape from ourselves, from our own loneliness, from our own inward uncertainty and poverty, and so we cling to the outer things of relationship, which become very important to us. But if, instead of escaping through relationship, we can look into relationship as a mirror and see very clearly, without any prejudice, exactly what is, then that very perception brings about a transformation of what is, without any effort to transform it. There is nothing to transform about a fact; it is what it is. But we approach the fact with hesitation, with fear, with a sense of prejudice, and so we are always acting upon the fact and therefore never perceiving the fact as it is. When we see the fact as it is, then that very fact is the truth which resolves the problem.</p>
<p>So, in all this the important thing is not what another says, however great or stupid he may be, but to be aware of oneself, to see the fact of what is, from moment to moment, without accumulating. When you accumulate, you cannot see the fact; then you see the accumulation, and not the fact. But when you can see the fact independently of the accumulation, independently of the thought process, which is the response of accumulated experience, then it is possible to go beyond the fact. It is the avoidance of the fact that brings about conflict, but when you recognize the truth of the fact, then there is a quietness of mind in which conflict ceases.</p>
<p>So, do what you will, you cannot escape through relationship; and if you do escape, you will only create further isolation, further misery and confusion, because to use relationship as a means of self-fulfillment is to deny relationship. If we look at this problem very clearly, we can see that life is a process of relationship; and if, instead of understanding relationship, we seek to withdraw from it, enclosing ourselves in ideas, in superstitions, in various forms of addiction, these self-enclosures only create more of the very conflict we are trying to avoid.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Our conflict is in relationship... and the understanding of this relationship... is the only real problem that each one has.</p>
<p>Self-knowledge is not a thing to be bought in books, nor is it the outcome of a long painful practice and discipline, but it is awareness, from moment to moment, of every thought and feeling as it arises in relationship. Relationship is not on an abstract, ideological level but an actuality&mdash;the relationship with property, with people, and with ideas. Relationship implies existence and, as nothing can live in isolation, to be is to be related. Our conflict is in relationship, at all the levels of our existence, and the understanding of this relationship, completely and extensively, is the only real problem that each one has. This problem cannot be postponed nor be evaded. The avoidance of it only creates further conflict and misery; the escape from it only brings about thoughtlessness, which is exploited by the crafty and the ambitious.</p>

<p>To understand conflict, we must understand relationship, and the understanding of relationship does not depend on memory, on habit, on what has been or what should be. It depends on choiceless awareness from moment to moment, and if we go into it deeply, we shall see that in that awareness there is no accumulative process at all. The moment there is accumulation, there is a point from which to examine, and that point is conditioned; and hence, when we regard relationship from a fixed point, there must be pain, there must be conflict.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Self-knowledge is not a result...</p>
<p>To understand the whole process of oneself requires constant alertness, awareness, in the action of relationship. There must be a constant watching of every incident, without choice, without condemnation or acceptance, with a certain sense of dispassion, so that the truth of every incident is revealed. But this self-knowledge is not a result, an end. There is no end to self-knowledge; it is a constant process of understanding, which comes about only when one begins objectively and goes deeper and deeper into the whole problem of daily living &mdash; which is the ‘you’ and the ‘me’ in relationship.</p>

<p class="subtitle">When I can look at you and you can look at me without the image of memory... then there is a relationship.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>What relation has the observer, my observer, to other observers, to other people?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What do we mean by that word relationship? Are we ever related to anyone, or is the relationship between two images which we have created about each other? I have an image about you, and you have an image about me. I have an image about you as my wife or husband, or whatever it is, and you an image about me also. The relationship is between these two images and nothing else. To have relationship with another is only possible when there is no image. When I can look at you and you can look at me without the image of memory, of insults, and all the rest, then there is a relationship, but the very nature of the observer is the image, isn’t it? My image observes your image, if it is possible to observe it, and this is called relationship, but it is between two images, a relationship which is nonexistent because both are images. To be related means to be in contact. Contact must be something direct, not between two images. It requires a great deal of attention, an awareness, to look at another without the image which I have about that person, the image being my memories of that person&mdash; how he has insulted me, pleased me, given me pleasure, this or that. Only when there are no images between the two is there a relationship.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Why does one create an image about oneself?</p>
<p>One has an idea, a symbol of oneself, an image of oneself: what one should be, what one is, or what one should not be. Why does one create an image about oneself? Because one has never studied what one is, actually. We think we should be this or that: the ideal, the hero, the example. What awakens anger is that our ideal, the idea we have of ourselves, is attacked. And our idea about ourselves is our escape from the fact of what we are. But when you are observing the actual fact of what you are, no one can hurt you. Then, if one is a liar and is told that one is a liar, it does not mean that one is hurt: it is a fact. But when you are pretending you are not a liar and are told that you are, then you get angry, violent. So, we are always living in an ideational world, a world of myth, and never in the world of actuality. To observe what is, to see it, actually be familiar with it, there must be no judgment, no evaluation, no opinion, no fear.</p>

<p class="subtitle">What happens when I am aware of the fact that I have built an image of myself ?</p>
<p>One generally has an image of oneself as an extraordinary human being, or as a man who has failed, a man who is miserable, who must fulfill, who is vain, ambitious&mdash;you know the image which most people have of themselves. They think that they are God, or not God, that they are merely environment, that they are this or they are that. They have a dozen images of themselves, or one predominant image. Now, if I have an image of myself, then that image will contradict the facts of daily existence, and I am incapable of looking at the daily facts except through the eyes of that image; therefore, the problem is created by the image and not by the fact itself.</p>
<p>So then, why do I build an image of myself? I see that as long as I have a concept, an image, a conclusion about myself, problems will exist. So I am no longer concerned with the problem, with the difficulty; I am concerned now with understanding why I have these images, these concepts, these conclusions about myself. In the East people have the idea that they are God, they have innumerable concepts; and here in the West you also have your concepts, your images. Go to the communist world, and they have their images too. Now, why do we build these images, these concepts?</p>
<p>Please, I am putting the question, and do try to find out. We are asking a fundamental, not a superficial question. Most of us never ask ourselves a fundamental question, but this is a fundamental question we are asking ourselves now.</p>
<p>Why have I, who have lived forty, fifty, sixty&mdash;or whatever number of years it is that one has lived&mdash;why have I gathered this storehouseful of what I think, what I feel, what I am, what I should be, this accumulation of experience, knowledge? And if I had not done that, what would happen? Do you understand? If I had no concept about myself, what would happen to me? I would be lost, wouldn’t I? I would be uncertain, terribly frightened of life. So I build an image, a myth, a concept, a conclusion about myself, because without this framework life would become for me utterly meaningless, uncertain, fearful: there would be no security. I may be secure outwardly; I may have a job, a house, and all the rest of it, but inwardly also I want to be completely secure. And it is the desire to be secure that compels me to build this image of myself, which is verbal. Do you understand? It has no reality at all; it is merely a concept, a memory, an idea, a conclusion.</p>
<p>Now, I see that to be a fact, that is, I am aware of it. Please proceed with me, let us do this together. I know why I have built up an image of myself&mdash;whether through conscious effort, or unconsciously, through the innumerable influences of society, of organized religion, of books&mdash;I know all that. I have built it up, and I see why I have built it up: society demands it; and also, apart from society, I want to be completely sure of myself. Society helps me, and I help myself, to be that image, that idea, that conclusion, and I am aware of this whole process.</p>
<p>Now, what happens when I am aware of the fact that I have built an image of myself, as aware of it as I am aware of hunger? You know, we are so used to making effort. From childhood we are encouraged to make effort, struggle, because we must be better than somebody else, do better than our uncle&mdash;you know, all the rest of that stupid stuff. We worship success, so we make effort. But here there is no effort needed at all because there is nothing to make effort about. Are you following? So, I am just observing the fact that I have an image of myself. Any effort to change, to encourage, or to dissipate that image is to conform to another image which I have of myself. Is that clear? If I make an effort to dissipate or destroy the present image, that effort springs from still another image which I have made of myself, and which says that this present image must not be... .</p>
<p>So, the mind is aware that it has created an image of itself, and that to try to dissipate, or to resolve, or to do anything about that image, springs from still another image which is much deeper and which says, “I must not create an image.” Any effort to alter the present image is the outcome of a deeper image, a deeper conclusion. I see that to be a fact; therefore, the mind is not making any effort to dispel the image. Are you following? So, the mind is completely aware of the image without any desire, without any effort, without any alteration; it is just aware of it, just looking at it. I look at that microphone, and I can’t do anything about it. It is there, it has been put together. Similarly, the mind looks at the image, at the conclusion it has about itself, without any form of effort, and that is real attention. In that observation you will discover there is tremendous discipline&mdash;not the silly discipline of conformity. Because there is no effort to alter it, the mind itself is that image. It is not the mind and the image, but the mind is the image. Any movement on the part of the mind to identify itself with that image or to destroy it is the creation or the urge of another image; therefore, the mind is completely aware that it is itself the creator of the image.</p>
<p>If you really see this fact, then the image loses its significance altogether. Then the mind is capable of dealing with any issue, any crisis that arises, without a previous conclusion of the image from which it tries to answer. The mind is now clear of all images, and therefore it has no static position, no platform from which it observes, no belief, no dogma, no experience as knowledge from which it is approaching the issue. So, the mind can now be completely with any issue that arises, and doesn’t treat it as a problem. Problems exist only when there is a contradiction, but here there is no contradiction. I have no image, no center, no conclusions from which I look; hence, there is no contradiction and therefore no problem.</p>

You see, we have an image of what it is to be nothing, and we don’t like that image; but the actual fact of being nothing, when you have no image, may be entirely different. And it is entirely different. It is not a state that can be realized in terms of being nothing or of being something. It is entirely different when there is no image of yourself. And to have no image of yourself demands tremendous attention, tremendous seriousness. It is only the attentive, the serious, that live, not the people who have images of themselves.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Is it possible to observe without the thinker?</p>
<p>Thought&mdash;please listen carefully&mdash;thought thinks about something. Thought divides itself into the observer, the feeler, the experiencer, and the thing to be experienced. Thought, having divided itself into the observer and the thing observed, obviously brings about a conflict. Then thought says, “I must get over the conflict,” and invents disciplines, resistances, various forms of cunning escapes. We see that the origin of thinking is pleasure. All our activities, all our values&mdash; moral, ethical, and religious&mdash;are based on pleasure. As long as there is this dual existence which thought has created, as the observer who is going to derive pleasure from the observed, as long as thought is functioning that way, there will always be conflict, and therefore no radical revolution at all.</p>
<p>Is this fairly clear? No, not my explanation! Someone can probably give you a better explanation; we’re not concerned with explanations, we’re concerned with seeing what is, the fact. I’ve had a beautiful experience of a sunset yesterday in the country, the trees against the sun, the loveliness of shadow, the depth, the beauty, from which I have derived tremendous pleasure. Thought thinks about it; I must go back there tomorrow, or keep the memory. I keep it because my life is so shoddy, so dull, so boring, so routine that I’m caught in that beauty which I saw yesterday. I’ve listened to a sound, to music, to a poem; I’ve looked at a painting. I think about it. I’m caught in it and I want more of it. I see a beautiful face; I want to live with it. Again thought is functioning with pleasure. There is the observer, the thinker, and there is the thought, which is pleasure. The thinker has been built on the basis of pleasure: “I want this and I don’t want that.” “This is good,” which means essentially that there is pleasure. As long as this division between the observer and the observed exists, there can be no radical mutation of consciousness.</p>
<p>Is it possible to observe without the thinker? I look at everything with an image, with a symbol, with memory, with knowledge. I look at my friend, at my wife, at my neighbor, at the boss, with the image which thought has built. I look at my wife with the image I have about her, and she looks at me with the image she has about me: the relationship is between these two images. This is a fact&mdash;it’s not an invention on my part&mdash;it’s a fact! Thought has built these symbols, images, ideas. Can I look, at first, at a tree, at a flower, at the sky, at the cloud, without an image? The image of the tree is the word I have learned which gives a certain name to the tree, tells its species and recalls its beauty. Can I look at that tree, at that cloud, at that flower, without thought, without the image? That’s fairly easy to do, if you have done it. But can I look&mdash; without the image&mdash;at a human being with whom I am intimate, whom I consider as wife, husband, child? If I can’t, there is no real relationship: the only relationship is between the images that we both have. So, can I look at life&mdash;the clouds, the stars, the trees, the river, the bird on the wing, my wife, my child, my neighbor, this whole earth&mdash;can I look at it all without the image? Though you have insulted me, though you have hurt me, though you have said nasty things about me or praised me, can I look at you without the image or the memory of what you have done and said to me?</p>
<p>Do see the importance of this, because it’s only a mind that has retained the memories of hurt, of insult, that is ready to forgive, if it is at all inclined that way. A mind that is not storing up its insults, the flatteries that it receives, has nothing to forgive or not forgive; therefore there is no conflict. Thought has created these images, both inwardly and outwardly. Can the images come to an end, and thought look at everything in life afresh? If you can do this, you will find that without your conscious, deliberate effort to change, change has taken place, a radical change. Most people are ambitious; they want to be somebody: authors, painters, businessmen, or politicians. Priests want to become archbishops. Thought has created this society and sees the advantage of becoming powerful, dominant, an important person, which happens only through ambition. Thought has created the image through observation of the man in power and wants the pleasure of owning a big house, having a picture appear in the papers, and all the rest of it.</p>
<p>Can one live in this world without ambition, without the image of pleasure which thought has created? Can one function technologically, outwardly, without this poison of ambition? It can be done, but it is possible only when we understand the origin of thinking and understand actually, factually, the unreality of the division between the observer and the observed. Then we can proceed, because then virtue has a totally different meaning. It is not the moral virtue of an ugly, corrupt society, but virtue which is order. Virtue, like humility, is not something to be cultivated by thought. Thought is not virtuous; it is bourgeois, petty, and thought cannot possibly understand either love or virtue or humility.</p>

<p class="subtitle">When one has a certain feeling, can that feeling be left unnamed and be looked at purely as a fact?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You have suggested that through awareness alone, transformation is possible. What do you mean by awareness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, this is a very complex question, but I shall try to describe what it is to be aware, if you will kindly listen and patiently follow it step by step, right through to the end. To listen is not just to follow what I am describing but actually to experience what is being described, which means watching the operation of your own mind as I describe it. If you merely follow what is being described, then you are not aware, observant, watchful of your own mind. Merely to follow a description is like reading a guidebook while the scenery goes by unobserved, but if you watch your own mind while listening, then the description will have significance, and you will find out for yourself what it means to be aware.</p>
<p>What do we mean by awareness? Let us begin at the simplest level. You are aware of the noise that is going on; you are aware of the cars, the birds, the trees, the electric lights, the people sitting around you, the still sky, the breathless air. Of all that you are aware, are you not? Now, when you hear a noise, or a song, or see a cart being pushed, and so on, what is heard or observed is translated, judged by the mind; that is what you are doing, is it not? Please follow this slowly. Each experience, each response, is interpreted according to your background, according to your memory. If there were a noise which you were hearing for the first time, you would not know what it was; but you have heard the noise a dozen times before, so your mind immediately translates it, which is the process of what we call thinking. Your reaction to a particular noise is the thought of a cart being pushed, which is one form of awareness. You are aware of color, you are aware of different faces, different attitudes, expressions, prejudices, and so on. And, if you are at all alert, you are also aware of how you respond to these things, not only superficially, but deeply. You have certain values, ideals, motives, urges, on different levels of your being; and to be conscious of all that is part of awareness. You judge what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong; you condemn, evaluate, according to your background, that is, according to your education and the culture in which you have been brought up. To see all this is part of awareness, is it not?</p>
<p>Now, let us go a little further. What happens when you are aware that you are greedy, violent, or envious? Let us take envy, and stick to that one thing. Are you aware that you are envious? Please go with me step by step, and bear in mind that you are not following a formula. If you make it into a formula, you will have lost the significance of the whole thing. I am unfolding the process of awareness, but if you merely learn by heart what has been described, you will be exactly where you are now; whereas, if you begin to see your conditioning, which is to be aware of the operation of your own mind as I go on explaining, then you will come to the point where an actual transformation is possible.</p>
<p>So, you are aware not only of outward things and your interpretation of them, but you have also begun to be aware of your envy. Now, what happens when you are aware of envy in yourself? You condemn it, don’t you? You say that it is wrong, that you must not be envious, that you must be loving, which is the ideal. The fact is that you are envious, while the ideal is what you should be. In pursuing the ideal, you have created a duality, so there is a constant conflict, and in that conflict you are caught.</p>
<p>Are you aware, as I am describing this process, that there is only one thing, which is the fact that you are envious? The other, the ideal, is nonsense, it is not an actuality. And it is very difficult for the mind to be free of the ideal, to be free of the opposite, because traditionally, through centuries of a particular culture, we have been taught to accept the hero, the example, the ideal of the perfect man, and to struggle towards it. That is what we have been trained to do. We want to change envy into nonenvy, but we have never found out how to change it, and so we are caught in everlasting strife.</p>
<p>Now, when the mind is aware that it is envious, that very word envious is condemnatory. Are you following, sirs? The very naming of that feeling is condemnatory, but the mind cannot think except in words. That is, a feeling arises with which a certain word is identified, so the feeling is never independent of the word. The moment there is a feeling like envy, there is naming, so you are always approaching a new feeling with an old idea, an accumulated tradition. The feeling is always new, and it is always translated in terms of the old.</p>
<p>Now, can the mind not name a feeling like envy but come to it afresh, anew? The very naming of that feeling is to make it old, to capture it and put it into the old framework. And can the mind not name a feeling&mdash;that is, not translate it by calling it a name, and thereby either condemning or accepting it&mdash;but merely observe the feeling as a fact?</p>
<p>Sir, experiment with yourself, and you will see how difficult it is for the mind not to verbalize, not to give a name to a fact. That is, when one has a certain feeling, can that feeling be left unnamed and be looked at purely as a fact? If you can have a feeling and really pursue it to the end without naming it, then you will find that something very strange happens to you. At present, the mind approaches a fact with an opinion, with evaluation, with judgment, with denial or acceptance: that is what you are doing. There is a feeling, which is a fact, and the mind approaches that fact with a term, with an opinion, with judgment, with a condemnatory attitude, which are dead things. Do you understand? They are dead things, they have no value, they are only memory operating on the fact. The mind approaches the fact with a dead memory; therefore, the fact cannot operate on the mind. But if the mind merely observes the fact without evaluation, without judgment, condemnation, acceptance, or identification, then you will find that the fact itself has an extraordinary vitality because it is new. What is new can dispel the old; therefore, there is no struggle not to be envious&mdash;there is the total cessation of envy. It is the fact that has vigor, vitality, not your judgments and opinions about the fact; and to think the thing right through, from the beginning to the end, is the whole process of awareness.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Can’t I just look?</p>
<p>Can I look without the word at every problem: the problem of fear, the problem of pleasure? Because the word creates, breeds thought; and thought is memory, experience, pleasure, and therefore a distorting factor.</p>
<p>This is really quite astonishingly simple. Because it is simple, we mistrust it. We want everything to be very complicated, very cunning; and all cunning is covered with a perfume of words. If I can look at a flower nonverbally&mdash;and I can; anyone can do it, if one gives sufficient attention&mdash;can’t I look with that same objective, nonverbal attention at the problems which I have? Can’t I look out of silence, which is nonverbal, without the thinking machinery of pleasure and time being in operation? Can’t I just look? I think that’s the crux of the whole matter&mdash;not to approach from the periphery, which only complicates life tremendously, but to look at life, with all its complex problems of livelihood, sex, death, misery, sorrow, the agony of being tremendously alone&mdash;to look at all that without association, out of silence, which means without a center, without the word which creates the reaction of thought, which is memory and hence time. I think that is the real problem, the real issue: whether the mind can look at life where there is immediate action, not an idea and then action, and eliminate conflict altogether.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Do you mean that you can look at something the same way you look at a flower, without using it, without making use of it? Is that what you had in mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sir, you look at a flower, actually look at it. There is no thought behind it. You are looking at it non-botanically, nonspeculatively; you don’t classify it, you just look. Have you never done this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Doesn’t the mind enter in?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait, wait, no, don’t talk about the mind. That’s a little more complicated. Begin with the flower. When you look at a flower, do not let thought interfere; then see if you can look at your wife or husband or neighbor or country in the same way. If one cannot, one says, “Is there a method, a system by which I can train my mind to look without the interference of thought?” It becomes too absurd. The fact is that we do look at a flower without the interference of thought as memory or as pleasure. Can there be observation, in the same way, of everything that arises in us and outside us&mdash;the words we use, the gestures, the ideas, the concepts, the self-identifying memories, the images that we have of ourselves and of others? To be so widely aware is only possible when there is an observation of things external, when one can look at a cloud, a tree, without the interference of words.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>It is not just the interference of words or associations; it is the swiftness of associations.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, sir, the swiftness of association; therefore, you are not looking. If I want to see you or see the cloud, see my wife or husband, I must look and not let the association interfere; but the word, the association, interferes instantly because behind it there is pleasure. Do see this, sirs; it’s so simple. Once we understand this thing clearly, then we will be able to look.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You said that we should look at the flower without thought and without feeling, and if one is able to do that, one gets tremendous energy. This energy, as we use the word, is thinking and feeling. I wonder if you would clarify this.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, you see, sir, I purposely said thought is feeling. There is no feeling without thought, and behind thought is pleasure, so those things go together&mdash;pleasure, the word, the thought, the feeling&mdash; they are not separated. Observation without thought, without feeling, without word is energy. Energy is dissipated by word, association, thought, pleasure, and time; therefore, there is no energy to look.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>If you see that, then thought is not a distraction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then thought doesn’t enter into it, sir. It is not a question of distraction. I want to understand it. Why should thought interfere? Why should all my prejudices interfere with my looking, my understanding? It interferes because I’m afraid of you, you might get my job, ten different things. That’s why one must first look at a flower, a cloud. If I can look at a cloud without a word, without any of the associations that come in swiftly, then I can look at myself, at the whole of my life with all its problems. You may say, “Is that all? Haven’t you oversimplified it?” I don’t think so, because facts never create problems. The fact that I am afraid doesn’t create a problem, but the thought that says, “I must not be afraid,” brings in time and creates illusion&mdash;that creates a problem, not the fact.</p>

<h1>VII. Awareness and Human Problems</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Can the mind dissociate the feeling which is called envy from the word?</p>
<p>This is rather a complex process but, if you will kindly listen, I am sure you will get the significance of it. Let us say I am greedy, envious, and I want to understand that envy completely, not merely get rid of it. Most of us want to get rid of it and try various ways of doing that, for various reasons, but we are never able to get rid of it; it goes on and on indefinitely. But if I really want to understand it, go to the root of it completely, then I must not condemn it, surely. The very word envy has a condemnatory sense, I feel, so can the mind dissociate the feeling which is called envy from the word? Because the very terming, giving a name to that feeling as envy, with that very word I have condemned it, have I not? With the word envy is associated the whole psychological and religious significance of condemnation. So, can I dissociate the feeling from the word? If the mind is capable of not associating the feeling with the word, then is there an entity, a ‘me’, who is observing it? Because the observer is the association, surely, is the word, is the entity who is condemning it.</p>
<p>Let us go into this a little bit more. Please, if I may suggest, watch your own minds in operation; do not listen to me merely intellectually, verbally, but examine any particular feeling of envy or of violence with which you are familiar, and go into it with me.</p>
<p>Let us say I am envious. The ordinary response to that is either justifying it or condemning it. I am justifying when I say to myself, “I am not really envious. My desire to become somebody is a part of culture, a part of my society, and without it I shall be a nobody.” Or, I condemn it because I feel it is not spiritual, or for whatever reasons there may be. So, I approach that feeling which I call envy, either justifying it or condemning it. Now, if I do neither, which is extremely difficult because it means I have to free the mind from all my conditioning of the past, of the culture in which I have been brought up&mdash;if the mind is free of that&mdash;then the mind also must be free of the word, because that very word envy implies condemnation. You understand? Now, my mind is made up of words, of symbols, of ideas; those symbols, ideas, words are ‘me’. And can there be a feeling of envy when there is no verbalization, when there is the cessation of all that is associated with the ‘me’, which is the very essence of envy? So, is envy ever experienced when that ‘me’ is absent? Because that ‘me’ is the very essence of condemnation, verbalization, comparison.</p>
<p>To think out a thought completely, go to the very root of it, there must be an awareness in which there is no sense of condemnation, justification, and all the rest of it, nor any sense of trying to overcome a problem. Because if I am merely trying to dissolve a problem, then my attention is focussed on the dissolution of it, and not on the understanding of the problem. The problem is the way I think, the way I act; and if I condemn my way, the way I am, it obviously blocks further investigation. If I say, “I must not be this and I must be that,” then there is no understanding of the ways of the ‘me’, whose very nature is envy, acquisitiveness. The question is: Can I be so deeply aware without any sense of condemnation or comparison? For then only is it possible to think out a thought completely.</p>

<p class="subtitle">In this state of total awareness... you will find you have completely wiped away that feeling which is habitually identified with the word jealousy.</p>
<p><span>I have a certain feeling, and I give it a name. I give it a name because I want to know what it is; I call it jealousy, and that word is the outcome of my memory of the past. The feeling itself is something new; it has come into being suddenly, spontaneously, but I have identified it by giving it a name. In giving it a name, I think I have understood it, but I have only strengthened it. So, what has happened? The word has interfered with my looking at the fact.</span></p>
<p><span>I think I have understood the feeling by calling it jealousy, whereas I have only put it in the framework of words, of memory, with all the old impressions, explanations, condemnations, justifications. But that feeling itself is new; it is not something of yesterday. It becomes something of yesterday only when I give it a name. If I look at it without naming it, there is no center from which I am looking. Please see this. Are you working as hard as I am?</span></p>
<p><span>What I am saying is that the moment you give a name, a label, to that feeling, you have brought it into the framework of the old, and the old is the observer, the separate entity who is made up of words, of ideas, of opinions about what is right and what is wrong. Therefore, it is very important to understand the process of naming, and to see how instantaneously the word jealousy comes into being. But if you don’t name that feeling&mdash;which demands tremendous awareness, a great deal of immediate understanding&mdash;then you will find that there is no observer, no thinker, no center from which you are judging, and that you are not different from the feeling: there is no ‘you’ who feels it.</span></p>
<p><span>Jealousy has become a habit with most of us and, like any other habit, it continues. To break the habit is merely to be aware of the habit. Please listen to this. Do not say, “It is terrible to have this habit, I must change it, I must be free of it,” and so on, but just be aware of it. To be aware of a habit is not to condemn it, but simply to look at it. You know, when you love a thing, you look at it. It is only when you don’t love it that the problem of how to get rid of it begins. When I use the word love with regard to the feeling which we call jealousy, I hope you see what I mean. To love jealousy is not to deny or condemn that feeling; then there is no separation between the feeling and the observer. In this state of total awareness, if you go into it very deeply without words, you will find you have completely wiped away that feeling which is habitually identified with the word jealousy.</span></p>

<p class="subtitle">If you observe it with intensity, with a certain swiftness, you will go beyond ambition.</p>
<p>Now, what does it mean to observe, let us say, the movement of ambition? I am taking ambition as one of the ugly things in our life, although some of you may call it beautiful. What does it mean to observe the structure, the anatomy of ambition? Not the word, because the word is not the thing. The word tree is not the tree. You may say, “Yes, that is so,” but psychologically, when we observe ambition in ourselves, we immediately identify ourselves with that state, with that word, and we are caught in it. It is simple to see that the word tree is not the tree, but to observe in oneself, without the word, that extraordinary state called ambition is quite another matter. That state is built into you, into your thought, into your very being, by the society, the environment in which you live, by your education, by the church, by countless centuries of man’s aggressive endeavor to achieve, to get ahead, to kill, and all the rest of it. And what matters is to observe that state in yourself, not only now as we are talking about it, but to observe it as you go to the office, as you read in the newspaper the praise of some hero or successful man. If you observe without naming it, you will see that it is not a static thing but a movement unidentified with the word, and therefore unidentified with the name, with ‘you’. And if you observe it with intensity, with a certain swiftness, you will go beyond ambition; it will have lost its significance, and yet you can be totally in action. But to observe that state in oneself, to look at thinking without an observer, without a thinker who is watching, is extremely arduous.</p>
<p>Observation implies no accumulation of knowledge, even though knowledge is obviously necessary at a certain level: knowledge as a doctor, knowledge as a scientist, knowledge of history, of all the things that have been. After all, that is knowledge: information about the things that have been. There is no knowledge of tomorrow, only conjecture as to what might happen tomorrow, based on your knowledge of what has been. A mind that observes with knowledge is incapable of following swiftly the stream of thought. It is only by observing without the screen of knowledge that you begin to see the whole structure of your own thinking. And as you observe&mdash;which is not to condemn or accept, but simply to watch&mdash;you will find that thought comes to an end. Casually to observe an occasional thought leads nowhere, but if you observe the process of thinking and do not become an observer apart from the observed&mdash;if you see the whole movement of thought without accepting or condemning it&mdash;then that very observation puts an end immediately to thought, and therefore the mind is compassionate, it is in a state of constant mutation.</p>

<p class="subtitle">In the moment of being aware of fear, are you already in a state of flight from the fact?</p>
<p>Do please listen to this, it is not complicated. It demands attention, and attention has its own discipline; you don’t have to introduce a system of discipline. You know, sirs, what this world needs is not politicians, or more engineers, but free human beings. Engineers and scientists may be necessary, but it seems to me that what the world needs is human beings who are free, who are creative, who have no fear. And most of us are ridden with fear. If you can go profoundly into fear and really understand it, you will come out with innocency, so that your mind is clear. That is what we need, and that is why it is very important to understand how to look at a fact, how to look at your fear. That is the whole problem&mdash;not how to get rid of fear, not how to be courageous, not what to do about fear, but to be fully with the fact.</p>
<p>Sirs, you want to be fully, totally with the wave of pleasure, don’t you? And you are. When you are in the moment of pleasure, there is no condemnation, no justification, no denial. There is no factor of time at the moment of experiencing pleasure; physically, sensually, your whole being vibrates with it. Isn’t that so? When you are in the moment of experiencing, there is no time, is there? When you are intensely angry, or when you are full of lust, there is no time. Time comes in, thought comes in, only after the moment of experiencing, and then you say, “By Jove, how nice,” or, “how terrible.” If it was nice, you want more of it; if it was terrible, fearful, you want to avoid it; therefore, you begin to explain, to justify, to condemn, and these are the factors of time, which prevent you from looking at the fact.</p>
<p>Now, have you ever faced fear? Please listen to the question carefully. Have you ever looked at fear? Or, in the moment of being aware of fear, are you already in a state of flight from the fact? I will go into it a little bit, and you will see what I mean.</p>
<p>We name, we give a term to our various feelings, don’t we? In saying, “I am angry,” we have given a term, a name, a label to a particular feeling. Now, please watch your own minds very clearly. When you have a feeling, you name that feeling; you call it anger, lust, love, pleasure, don’t you? And this naming of the feeling is a process of intellection which prevents you from looking at the fact, that is, at the feeling.</p>
<p>You know, when you see a bird and say to yourself that it is a parrot or a pigeon or a crow, you are not looking at the bird. You have already ceased to look at the fact because the word parrot or pigeon or crow has come between you and the fact.</p>
<p>This is not some difficult intellectual feat but a process of the mind that must be understood. If you would go into the problem of fear or the problem of authority or the problem of pleasure or the problem of love, you must see that naming, giving a label, prevents you from looking at the fact. Do you understand?</p>
<p>You see a flower and you call it a rose, and the moment you have thus given it a name, your mind is distracted; you are not giving your full attention to the flower. So naming, terming, verbalizing, symbolizing, prevents total attention towards the fact. Right, sirs? Shall we go on? All right. We are continuing what we were talking about at the beginning. We are still asking ourselves if it is possible to be choicelessly aware of a fact, and the fact is fear.</p>
<p>Now, can the mind&mdash;which is addicted to symbols and whose very nature it is to verbalize&mdash;stop verbalizing and look at the fact? Don’t say, “How am I to do it?” but put the question to yourself. I have a feeling, and I call it fear. By giving it a name I have related it to the past, so memory, the word, the symbol, is preventing me from looking at the fact. Now, can the mind&mdash;which in its very thought process verbalizes, gives names&mdash;look at the fact without naming it? Do you understand? Sirs, you have to find this out for yourselves, I cannot tell you. If I tell you and you do it, you will be following, and you won’t be free of fear. What matters is that you should be totally free of fear, and not be halfdead human beings, corrupt, miserable people who are everlastingly afraid of their own shadow.</p>
<p>To understand this problem of fear, you have to go into it most profoundly, because fear is not merely on the surface of the mind. Fear is not just being afraid of your neighbor, or of losing a job; it is much deeper than that, and to understand it requires deep penetration. To penetrate deeply you need a very sharp mind, and the mind is not made sharp by mere argumentation or avoidance. One has to go into the problem step by step, and that is why it is very important to comprehend this whole process of naming. When you name a whole group of people by calling them Muslims, or what you will, you have got rid of them; you don’t have to look at them as individuals, so the name, the word, has prevented you from being a human being in relationship with other human beings. In the same way, when you name a feeling, you are not looking at the feeling, you are not totally with the fact.</p>
<p>You see, sirs, where there is fear there is no love; where there is fear, do what you will&mdash;go to all the temples in the world, follow all the gurus, repeat the Gita every day&mdash;you will never find reality, you will never be happy, you will remain immature human beings. The problem is to comprehend fear, not how to get rid of fear. If you merely want to get rid of fear, then take a pill which will tranquilize you, and go to sleep. There are innumerable forms of escape from fear, but if you escape, run away, fear will follow you everlastingly. To be fundamentally free of fear, you must understand this process of naming, and realize that the word is never the thing. The mind must be capable of separating the word from the feeling and must not let the word interfere with direct perception of the feeling, which is the fact.</p>
<p>When you have gone so far, penetrated so deeply, you will discover there is buried in the unconscious, in the obscure recesses of the mind, a sense of complete loneliness, of isolation, which is the fundamental cause of fear. And again, if you avoid it, if you escape from it, saying it is too fearful, if you do not go into it without giving it a name, you will never go beyond it. The mind has to come face to face with the fact of complete inward loneliness and not allow itself to do anything about that fact. That extraordinary thing called loneliness is the very essence of the self, the ‘me’, with all its chicaneries, its cunningness, its substitutions, its web of words in which the mind is caught. Only when the mind is capable of going beyond that ultimate loneliness is there freedom, the absolute freedom from fear. And only then will you find out for yourself what is reality, that immeasurable energy which has no beginning and no end. As long as the mind spawns its own fears in terms of time, it is incapable of understanding that which is timeless.</p>

<p class="subtitle">An innocent mind has no fear.</p>
<p>What brings freedom from fear&mdash;and I assure you the freedom is complete&mdash;is to be aware of fear without the word, without trying to deny or escape from fear, without wanting to be in some other state. If with complete attention you are aware of the fact that there is fear, then you will find that the observer and the observed are one: there is no division between them. There is no observer who says, “I am afraid”; there is only fear, without the word which indicates that state. The mind is no longer escaping, no longer seeking to get rid of fear, no longer trying to find the cause, and therefore it is no longer a slave to words. There is only a movement of learning, which is the outcome of innocence, and an innocent mind has no fear.</p>

<p class="subtitle">In the intensity of observation, of feeling, of real affection, love has its own action, which is not the contradictory action of desire.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>How can I be sensitive when I am tortured by desire?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why are we tortured by desire? Why have we made desire into a torturous thing? There is desire for power, desire for position, desire for fame, sexual desire, the desire to have money, to have a car, and so on. What do you mean by that word desire? And why is it wrong? Why do we say we must suppress or sublimate desire, do something about it? We are trying to find out. Don’t just listen to me, but go into it with me and find out for yourself.</p>
<p>What is wrong with desire? You have suppressed it, have you not? Most of you have suppressed desire, for various reasons&mdash;because it is not convenient, not satisfactory, or because you think it is not moral, or because the religious books say that to find God you must be without desire, and so on. Tradition says you must suppress, control, dominate desire, so you spend your time and energy in disciplining yourself.</p>
<p>Now, let us first see what happens to a mind that is always controlling itself, suppressing, sublimating desire. Such a mind, being occupied with itself, becomes insensitive. Though it may talk about sensitivity, goodness, though it may say that we must be brotherly, we must produce a marvelous world, and all the rest of the nonsense that people talk who suppress desire&mdash;such a mind is insensitive because it does not understand that which it has suppressed. Whether you suppress or yield to desire, it is essentially the same, because the desire is still there. You may suppress the desire for a woman, for a car, for position; but the very urge not to have these things, which makes you suppress the desire for them, is itself a form of desire. So, being caught in desire, you have to understand it, and not say it is right or wrong.</p>
<p>Now, what is desire? When I see a tree swaying in the wind, it is a lovely thing to watch, and what is wrong with that? What is wrong in watching the beautiful motion of a bird on the wing? What is wrong in looking at a new car, marvelously built and highly polished? And what is wrong in seeing a nice person with a symmetrical face, a face that shows good sense, intelligence, quality?</p>
<p>But desire does not stop there. Your perception is not just perception, but with it comes sensation. With the arising of sensation, you want to touch, to contact, and then comes the urge to possess. You say, “This is beautiful, I must have it,” and so begins the turmoil of desire.</p>
<p>Now, is it possible to see, to observe, to be aware of the beautiful and the ugly things of life, and not say, “I must have,” or, “I must not have”? Have you ever just observed anything? Do you understand, sirs? Have you ever observed your wife, your children, your friends, just looked at them? Have you ever looked at a flower without calling it a rose, without wanting to put it in your buttonhole, or take it home and give it to somebody? If you are capable of so observing, without all the values attributed by the mind, then you will find that desire is not such a monstrous thing. You can look at a car, see the beauty of it, and not be caught in the turmoil or contradiction of desire. But that requires an immense intensity of observation, not just a casual glance. It is not that you have no desire, but simply that the mind is capable of looking without describing. It can look at the moon and not immediately say, “That is the moon, how beautiful it is,” so there is no chattering of the mind coming in between. If you can do this, you will find that in the intensity of observation, of feeling, of real affection, love has its own action, which is not the contradictory action of desire.</p>
<p>Experiment with this and you will see how difficult it is for the mind to observe without chattering about what it observes. But surely, love is of that nature, is it not? How can you love if your mind is never silent, if you are always thinking about yourself? To love a person with your whole being, with your mind, heart, and body, requires great intensity; and when love is intense, desire soon disappears. But most of us have never had this intensity about anything, except about our own profit, conscious or unconscious; we never feel for anything without seeking something else out of it. But only the mind that has this intense energy is capable of following the swift movement of truth. Truth is not static, it is swifter than thought, and the mind cannot possibly conceive of it. To understand truth, there must be this immense energy, which cannot be conserved or cultivated. This energy does not come through self-denial, through suppression; on the contrary, it demands complete abandonment. And you cannot abandon yourself, or abandon everything that you have, if you merely want a result.</p>
<p>It is possible to live without envy in this world which is based on envy, on acquisitiveness, and the pursuit of power, position, but that requires an extraordinary intensity, a clarity of thought, of understanding. You cannot be free of envy without understanding yourself, so the beginning is here, not somewhere else. Unless you begin with yourself, do what you will, you will never find the end of sorrow. The purification of the mind is meditation&mdash;the purification of the mind which is concerned with itself. You have to understand yourself, and you can play with it a little bit every day. A man who plays with the understanding of himself will perceive far more than he who preaches to others.</p>

<p class="subtitle">When thought thinks about desire&mdash;and thought will always think about desire&mdash;out of that, it derives pleasure.</p>
<p>Then one asks, “Is it possible for thought not to touch desire?” You follow it? That is your problem. When you see something extraordinarily beautiful, full of life and beauty, you must never let thought come in, because the moment thought touches it, thought being old, it will pervert it into pleasure and, therefore, there arises the demand for pleasure and for more and more of pleasure; and when it is not given, there is conflict, there is fear. So, is it possible to look at a thing without thought? To look, you must be tremendously alive, not paralyzed. But the religious people have said to you, “Be paralyzed, come to reality crippled.” But you can never come to reality, crippled. To see reality, you must have a clear mind, unperverted, innocent, unconfused, untortured, free; then only can you see reality. If you see a tree, you must look at it with clear eyes, without the image. When thought thinks about desire&mdash;and thought will always think about desire&mdash;out of that, it derives pleasure. There is the image which thought has created about the object, and constant thinking about that image, that symbol, that picture, gives rise to pleasure. You see a beautiful head, you look at it. Thought says, “It is a beautiful head, it’s a nice head, it has got nice hair.” It begins to think about it, and it is pleasurable.</p>
<p>To see something without thought does not mean that you should stop thinking&mdash;that is not the point. But you must be aware when thought interferes with desire, knowing that desire is perception, sensation, contact. You must be aware of the whole mechanism of desire, and also when thought precipitates instantly on it. And that requires not only intelligence but awareness, so that you are aware when you see something extraordinarily beautiful or extraordinarily ugly. Then, the mind is not comparing: beauty is not ugliness and ugliness is not beauty.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Can the mind be fully aware of the fact that it is lonely, insufficient, empty?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>How is it possible to free oneself from psychological dependence on others?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wonder if we are conscious that we do depend psychologically on others? Not that it is necessary or justifiable or wrong, psychologically, to depend on others, but are we, first of all, aware that we are dependent? Most of us are psychologically dependent, not only on people, but on property, on beliefs, on dogmas. Are we at all conscious of that fact? If we know that we do depend on something for our psychological happiness, for our inward stability, security, then we can ask ourselves why.</p>
<p>Why do we psychologically depend on something? Obviously, because in ourselves we are insufficient, poor, empty; in ourselves we are extraordinarily lonely, and it is this loneliness, this emptiness, this extreme inward poverty and self-enclosure that makes us depend on a person, on knowledge, on property, on opinion, and on so many other things which seem necessary to us.</p>
<p>Now, can the mind be fully aware of the fact that it is lonely, insufficient, empty? It is very difficult to be aware, to be fully cognizant of that fact because we are always trying to escape from it; and we do temporarily escape from it through listening to the radio, and other forms of amusement, through going to church, performing rituals, acquiring knowledge, and through dependence on people and on ideas. To know your own emptiness, you must look at it, but you cannot look at it if your mind is all the time seeking a distraction from the fact that it is empty. And that distraction takes the form of attachment to a person, to the idea of God, to a particular dogma or belief, and so on.</p>
<p>So, can the mind stop running away, escaping, and not merely ask how to stop running away? Because the very inquiry into how the mind is to stop escaping becomes another escape. If I know that a certain path does not lead anywhere, I do not walk on that path; there is no question of how not to walk on it. Similarly, if I know that no escape, no amount of running away will ever resolve this loneliness, this inward emptiness, then I stop running, I stop being distracted. Then the mind can look at the fact that it is lonely, and there is no fear. It is in the very process of running away from what is that fear arises.</p>
<p>So, when the mind understands the futility, the utter uselessness of trying to fill its own emptiness through dependence, through knowledge, through belief, then it is capable of looking at it without fear. And, can the mind continue to look at that emptiness without any evaluation? I hope you are following this. It may sound rather complex, and probably it is, but can we not go into it very deeply? Because a superficial answer is completely meaningless.</p>
<p>When the mind is fully aware that it escapes, runs away from itself, when it realizes the futility of running away and sees that the very process of running away creates fear&mdash;when it realizes the truth of that, then it can face what is. Now, what do we mean when we say that we are facing what is? Are we facing it, looking at it, if we are always giving a value to it, interpreting it, if we have opinions about it? Surely, opinions, values, interpretations merely prevent the mind from looking at the fact. If you want to understand the fact, it is no good having an opinion about it.</p>
<p>So, can we look, without any evaluation, at the fact of our psychological emptiness, our loneliness, which breeds so many other problems? I think that is where the difficulty lies&mdash;in our incapacity to look at ourselves without judgment, without condemnation, without comparison, because we have all been trained to compare, to judge, to evaluate, to give an opinion. Only when the mind sees the futility of all that, the absurdity of it, is it capable of looking at itself. Then that which we have feared as being lonely, empty, is no longer empty. Then there is no psychological dependence on anything; then love is no longer attachment, but something entirely different, and relationship has quite another meaning.</p>
<p>But to find that out for oneself and not merely repeat it verbally, one must understand the process of escape. In the very understanding of escape there is the stopping of escape, and the mind is able to look at itself. In looking at itself, there must be no evaluation, no judgment. Then the fact is important in itself and there is complete attention, without any desire for distraction; therefore, the mind is no longer empty. Complete attention is the good.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Can the mind be aware of that emptiness without naming it?</p>
<p>I think most of us are aware&mdash;perhaps only rarely since most of us are so terribly occupied and active&mdash;but I think we are aware, sometimes, that the mind is empty. And, being aware, we are afraid of that emptiness. We have never inquired into that state of emptiness, we have never gone into it deeply, profoundly; we are afraid, and so we wander away from it. We have given it a name, we say it is “empty,” it is “terrible,” it is “painful”; and that very giving it a name has already created a reaction in the mind, a fear, an avoidance, a running away.</p>
<p>Now, can the mind stop running away, and not give it a name, not give it the significance of a word such as empty about which we have memories of pleasure and pain? Can we look at it, can the mind be aware of that emptiness without naming it, without running away from it, without judging it, but just be with it? Because, then, that is the mind. Then there is not an observer looking at it; there is no censor who condemns it; there is only that state of emptiness with which we are all really quite familiar but which we are all avoiding, trying to fill it with activity, with worship, with prayer, with knowledge, with every form of illusion and excitement. But when all the excitement, illusion, fear, running away stops, and you are no longer giving it a name and thereby condemning it, is the observer different then from the thing which is observed? Surely, by giving it a name, by condemning it, the mind has created a censor, an observer, outside of itself. But when the mind does not give it a term, a name, condemn it, judge it, then there is no observer, only a state of that thing we have called emptiness.</p>

<p class="subtitle">It is possible to stop escapes only when you are aware that you are escaping.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I have tried very hard but cannot stop drinking. What should I do?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You know, each one of us has various escapes. You take a drink, and I follow a Master. You are addicted to knowledge, and I to amusement. All escapes are similar, are they not?, whether one takes to drink, follows a Master, or is addicted to knowledge; they are all the same, surely, because the intention, the purpose, is to escape. Perhaps drinking may have a social value, or may be more harmful, but I am not at all sure that the ideational escapes are not worse. They are much more subtle, more hidden, and more difficult do be aware of. A man addicted to rituals, ceremonies, is no different from the man addicted to drink because both are trying to escape through stimulants.</p>
<p>And I think it is possible to stop escapes only when you are aware that you are escaping, that you are using all these things&mdash;drink, Masters, ceremonies, knowledge, love of country, what you will&mdash;as stimulants, sensations, to get away from yourself. After all, there are various ways to stop drinking. But if you merely stop drinking, you will take up something else. You may become a nationalist, or pursue some teacher on the other side of the world, or become ideationally fanciful.</p>
<p>Surely, the reason for escape is obvious: we are dissatisfied with ourselves, with our state, outwardly and inwardly. And so we have many escapes, and we think we shall understand, dissolve the escape, the drinking, when we discover the cause. When we know the cause of escape, do we stop escaping? When I know that I am drinking because I am quarrelling with my wife or because I have a rotten job&mdash;when I know the cause, do I stop drinking? Surely not. I stop drinking only when I establish right relationship with my wife, with another, and remove the conflict which is causing pain.</p>
<p>That is, to put it differently, as long as I am seeking self-fulfillment, in which there is frustration, there must be an escape. As long as I am frustrated, I must find an escape. When I want to be something&mdash;a politician, a leader, the pupil of a Master, anything&mdash;as long as I want to be something, I am inviting frustration; and, as being frustrated is painful, I seek an escape from it, whether it is a drink, or a Master, or a ceremony, or becoming a politician&mdash;it doesn’t matter what it is&mdash;they are all the same.</p>
<p>So, then, the question arises, is there self-fulfillment? Can the self, the‘me’, be something, become something? And what is the ‘me’ which wants to become something? The ‘me’ is a bundle of memories, a chain of memories in reaction with the present; I am the result of the past in conjunction with the present. And that ‘me’ wants to perpetuate itself through family, through a name, through property, through ideas. The ‘me’ is merely an idea, an idea which is satisfying, giving sensations, and to that the mind clings&mdash;the mind is that. And, as long as the mind is seeking fulfillment as the ‘me’, obviously there must be frustration; as long as I give importance to myself as being something, there must be frustration; as long as I am the center of everything, of my thoughts, my reactions, as long as I give myself importance, there must be frustration. Therefore, there must be pain, and from that pain we try to escape through innumerable ways. And the means of escape are similar.</p>
<p>So, don’t let us worry over the means of escape&mdash;whether yours is superior to mine. What is important is to realize that, as long as one is seeking fulfillment in the self, there must be misery, strife; and this misery cannot be avoided as long as the self is important, the ‘me’ is important.</p>
<p>So, you will say, “What has drinking got to do with all this? You haven’t answered my question, how to stop drinking.” I think the problem of drinking, as any other problem, can be understood and put an end to only when I understand the process of myself, when there is self-knowledge. And that understanding of oneself requires constant watchfulness&mdash;not a conclusion, not something you can hold on to, but constant awareness of every movement of thought and feeling. And, to be so aware is tiresome, and so we say, “Oh, it isn’t worth it.” We push it aside, and therefore increase the sorrow, the pain. But, surely, only in understanding oneself as a total process do we solve the innumerable problems that we have.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Most of us don’t want to be intensely aware; it is too disturbing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>How is it possible to be intensely aware while one is occupied with a particular job?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I do not see the difficulty. Why can’t one be intensely aware while doing the job? Whether the job is mechanical, scientific, or bureaucratic, in being intensely aware while you are doing that job, you will not only do it more efficiently but you will also begin to be aware of why you are doing it, what are the motives behind your work. You will find out if you are afraid of your boss; you will observe how you talk to your underlings and to those above you. Being intensely aware in your relationship with others, you will know whether you are creating enmity, jealousy, hatred; you will see all your own responses in relationship, whether you are here, in a bus, in your office, or in the factory. All this is implied in intense awareness.</p>
<p>Also, if you are intensely aware, you might give up your job. Therefore, most of us don’t want to be intensely aware; it is too disturbing; we would rather continue with what we are doing, even if it is very boring. At best, we break away from that which bores us and find a job which is less boring, but this too soon becomes routine.</p>
<p>So, we are caught in habit: the habit of going to the office every morning, the habit of smoking, the sexual habit, the habit of ideas, concepts, the habit of being an Englishman, and so on. We function in habit. To be intensely aware of habit has its own danger, and we are afraid of danger. We are afraid of not knowing, of not being certain. There is great beauty, there is great vitality, in not being certain. It is not insanity to be completely insecure; it doesn’t mean that one becomes psychotic. But none of us want that. We would rather break one habit and create a more pleasant habit.</p>

<p class="subtitle">It is futile to fight one habit by another habit.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>If I understand you rightly, awareness alone and by itself is sufficient to dissolve both the conflict and the source of it. I am perfectly aware, and have been for a long time, that I am “snobbish.” What prevents my getting rid of snobbishness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The questioner has not understood what I mean by awareness. If you have a habit, the habit of snobbishness for instance, it is no good merely to overcome this habit by another, its opposite. It is futile to fight one habit by another habit. What rids the mind of habit is intelligence. Awareness is the process of awakening intelligence, not creating new habits to fight the old ones. So, you must become conscious of your habits of thought, but do not try to develop opposite qualities or habits. If you are fully aware, if you are in that state of choiceless observation, then you will perceive the whole process of creating a habit and also the opposite process of overcoming it. This discernment awakens intelligence, which does away with all habits of thought. We are eager to get rid of those habits which give us pain or which we have found to be worthless, by creating other habits of thought and assertions. This process of substitution is wholly unintelligent. If you will observe you will find that mind is nothing but a mass of habits of thought and memories. By merely overcoming these habits by others, the mind still remains in prison, confused and suffering. It is only when we deeply comprehend the process of selfprotective reactions, which become habits of thought, limiting all action, that there is a possibility of awakening intelligence, which alone can dissolve the conflict of opposites.</p>

<p class="subtitle">To understand one habit is to open the door to understanding the whole machinery of habit.</p>
<p>So, I must first understand the futility of resistance or effort in breaking a habit. If that is clear, what happens? I become aware of the habit&mdash;fully aware of it. If I smoke, I observe myself doing it. I am aware of putting my hand in my pocket, bringing out the cigarettes, drawing one from the package, tapping it on my thumbnail or other hard surface, putting it in my mouth, lighting it, extinguishing the match, and puffing. I am aware of every movement, of every gesture, without condemning or justifying the habit, without saying it is right or wrong, without thinking, “How dreadful, I must be free of it,” and so on. I am aware without choice, step by step, as I smoke. You try it next time, that is, if you want to break the habit. And in understanding and breaking one habit, however superficial, you can go into the whole enormous problem of habit: habit of thought, habit of feeling, the habit of imitation&mdash;and the habit of hungering to be something, for this too is a habit. When you fight a habit, you give life to that habit, and then the fighting becomes another habit, in which most of us are caught. We only know resistance, which has become a habit. All our thinking is habitual, but to understand one habit is to open the door to understanding the whole machinery of habit. You find out where habit is necessary, as in speech, and where habit is completely corruptive.</p>

<p>You know, to live with the beauty of those mountains and not get accustomed to it is very difficult. Most of you have been here now for nearly three weeks. You have beheld those mountains, heard the stream, and seen the shadows creep across the valley, day after day. And have you not noticed how easily you get used to it all? You say, “Yes, it is quite beautiful,” and you pass by.

<p class="subtitle">A confused mind cannot find clarity.</p>
<p>A confused mind seeking clarity will only further confuse itself, because a confused mind can’t find clarity. It’s confused; what can it do? Any search on its part will only lead to further confusion. I think we don’t realize that. When it’s confused, one has to stop&mdash;stop pursuing any activity. And the very stopping is the beginning of the new, which is the most positive action, positive in a different sense altogether. All this implies that there must be profound self-knowing: to know the whole structure of one’s thinking-feeling, the motives, the fears, the anxieties, the guilt, the despair. To know the whole content of one’s mind, one has to be aware, aware in the sense of observing, not with resistance or with condemnation, not with approval or disapproval, not with pleasure or nonpleasure, just observing. That observation is the negation of the psychological structure of a society which says, “You must, you must not.” Therefore, self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom, and also, self-knowledge is the beginning and the ending of sorrow. Self-knowing is not to be bought in a book, or by going to a psychologist and being examined analytically. Self-knowledge is actually understanding what is in oneself: the pains, the anxieties&mdash;seeing them without any distortion. Out of this awareness clarity comes into being.</p>

<p class="subtitle">What is essential is to see that one is confused...</p>
<p>What is essential is to see that one is confused, that all activity, all action which springs from confusion, must be confused also. It’s like a confused person seeking a leader&mdash;his leader must also be confused. So, what is essential is to see that one is confused and not try to escape from it, not try to find explanations for it; be passively, choicelessly, aware. And then you will see that quite a different action springs from that passive awareness, because if you make an effort to clarify the state of confusion, what you create will still be confused. But, if you are aware of yourself, choicelessly, passively aware, then that confusion unfolds and fades away.</p>
<p>You will see, if you will experiment with this&mdash;and it will not take a long period of time, because time is not involved in it at all&mdash;that clarification comes into being. But you must give your whole attention, your whole interest, to it. And I am not at all sure that most of us do not like to be confused, because in the state of confusion you need not act. And so we are satisfied with the confusion, because to understand confusion demands action which is not the pursuit of an ideal or an ideation.</p>

<h1>VIII. Meditation and the Quiet Mind</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Just look without thought</p>
<p>I wonder if you have ever walked along a crowded street, or a lonely road, and just looked at things without thought? There is a state of observation without the interference of thought. Though you are aware of everything about you, and you recognize the person, the mountain, the tree, or the oncoming car, yet the mind is not functioning in the usual pattern of thought. I don’t know if this has ever happened to you. Do try it sometime when you are driving or walking. Just look without thought; observe without the reaction which breeds thought. Though you recognize color and form, though you see the stream, the car, the goat, the bus, there is no reaction, but merely negative observation; and that very state of so-called negative observation is action. Such a mind can utilize knowledge in carrying out what it has to do, but it is free of thought in the sense that it is not functioning in terms of reaction. With such a mind&mdash;a mind that is attentive without reaction&mdash;you can go to the office, and all the rest of it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">You cannot explore if you are not free.</p>
<p>The mind that would inquire&mdash;I am using the word inquire purposely&mdash;into what meditation is, must lay this foundation, which comes about naturally, spontaneously, with an ease of effortlessness, when there is self-knowing. And also, it is important to understand what this self-knowing is, just to be aware, without any choice, of the ‘me’ which has its source in a bundle of memories&mdash;I will go presently into what we mean by awareness&mdash;just to be conscious of it without interpretation, merely to observe the movement of the mind. But that observation is prevented when you are merely accumulating through observation: what to do, what not to do, what to achieve, what not to achieve. If you do that, you put an end to the living process of the movement of the mind as the self, that is, I have to observe and see the fact, the actual, the what is. If I approach it with an idea, with an opinion, such as “I must not” or “I must”&mdash;which are the responses of memory&mdash;then the movement of what is is hindered, is blocked, and therefore there is no learning.</p>
<p>To observe the movement of the breeze in the tree, you cannot do anything about it. It moves either with violence or with grace, with beauty. You, the observer, cannot control it. You cannot shape it, you cannot say, “I will keep it in my mind.” It is there. You may remember it, but if you remember it and recollect that breeze in the tree the next time you look at it, you are not looking at the natural movement of the breeze in the tree but only remembering the movement of the past; therefore, you are not learning, but you are merely adding to what you already know. So, knowledge becomes, at a certain level, an impediment to a further level.</p>
<p>I hope this is very clear. Because what we are going into presently demands a mind that is completely clear, capable of looking, seeing, listening, without any movement of recognition.</p>
<p>So, one must first be very clear, not confused. Clarity is essential. I mean by clarity seeing things as they are; seeing the what is without any opinion; seeing the movement of your mind; observing it very closely, minutely, diligently, without any purpose, without any directive. Just to observe demands astonishing clarity; otherwise, you cannot observe. If you would observe an ant moving about, doing all the activities it does, if you come to it with various biological facts about the ant, that knowledge prevents you from looking. So, you begin to see immediately where knowledge is necessary and where knowledge becomes an impediment. So, there is no confusion.</p>
<p>Where the mind is clear, precise, capable of deep, fundamental reasoning, it is in a state of negation. Most of us accept things so easily; we are so gullible because we want comfort, we want security, we want a sense of hope, we want somebody to save us&mdash;Masters, saviors, gurus, rishis&mdash;you know the whole mess of it! We accept readily, easily, and equally easily we deny, according to the climate of our mind.</p>
<p>So, clarity is in the sense of seeing things as they are within oneself. Because oneself is a part of the world; oneself is the movement of the world; oneself is the outer expression, which is the movement that goes inwardly: it is like the tide that goes out and comes in. Merely to concentrate on, or observe, yourself apart from the world leads you to isolation and to all forms of idiosyncrasy, neurosis, isolating fears, and so on. But if you observe the world and follow the movement of the world, and ride that movement as it comes within, then there is no division between you and the world, then you are not an individual opposed to the collective.</p>
<p>And there must be this sense of observation, which is both explorative&mdash;which is exploring&mdash;and observing, listening and being aware. I am using the word observing in that sense. The very act of observation is the act of exploration. You cannot explore if you are not free. Therefore, to explore, to observe, there must be clarity; to explore within yourself deeply, you must come to it each time afresh. That is, in that exploration you have never achieved a result, you have never climbed a ladder, and you never say, “Now I know.” There is no ladder. If you do climb, you must come down immediately so that your mind is tremendously sensitive to observe, to watch, to listen.</p>

<p class="subtitle">When the mind is free from all its projections, there is a state of quietness in which problems cease.</p>
<p>It is only the silent mind that shall see the truth, not the mind that makes an effort to see. Sir, if you are making an effort to hear what I am saying, will you hear? It is only when you are quiet, when you are really silent, that you understand. If you observe closely, listen quietly, then you will hear; but if you strain, struggle, to catch everything that is being said, your energy will be dissipated in the strain, in the effort. So, you will not find truth through effort; it does not matter who says it, whether the ancient books, the ancient saints, or the modern ones. Effort is the very denial of understanding, and it is only the quiet mind, the simple mind, the mind that is still, that is not overtaxed by its own efforts&mdash;only such a mind shall understand, shall see truth. Truth is not something in the distance; there is no path to it; there is neither your path nor my path; there is no devotional path, there is no path of knowledge or path of action, because truth has no path to it. The moment you have a path to truth, you divide it, because the path is exclusive, and what is exclusive at the very beginning will end in exclusiveness. The man who is following a path can never know truth because he is living in exclusiveness; his means are exclusive, and the means are the end, the means are not separate from the end. If the means are exclusive, the end is also exclusive.</p>
<p>So, there is no path to truth, and there are not two truths. Truth is not of the past or of the present, it is timeless; and the man who quotes the truth of the Buddha, of Shankara, of the Christ, or who merely repeats what I am saying, will not find truth, because repetition is not truth. Repetition is a lie. Truth is a state of being which arises when the mind&mdash;which seeks to divide, to be exclusive, which can think only in terms of results, of achievement&mdash;has come to an end. Only then will there be truth. The mind that is making effort, disciplining itself in order to achieve an end, cannot know truth, because the end is its own projection, and the pursuit of that projection, however noble, is a form of self-worship. Such a being is worshipping himself, and therefore he cannot know truth. Truth is to be known only when we understand the whole process of the mind, that is, when there is no strife. Truth is a fact, and the fact can be understood only when the various things that have been placed between the mind and the fact are removed. The fact is your relationship to property, to your wife, to human beings, to nature, to ideas; and, as long as you do not understand the fact of relationship, your seeking God merely increases the confusion because it is a substitution, an escape, and therefore it has no meaning.</p>
<p>As long as you dominate your wife or she dominates you, as long as you possess and are possessed, you cannot know love; as long as you are suppressing, substituting, as long as you are ambitious, you cannot know truth. It is not the denial of ambition that makes the mind calm, and virtue is not the denial of evil. Virtue is a state of freedom, of order, which evil cannot give, and the understanding of evil is the establishment of virtue. The man who builds churches or temples in the name of God with the money which he has gathered through exploitation, through deceit, through cunning and foul play, shall not know truth; he may be mild of tongue, but his tongue is bitter with the taste of exploitation, the taste of sorrow. He alone shall know truth who is not seeking, who is not striving, who is not trying to achieve a result. The mind itself is a result, and whatever it produces is still a result, but the man who is content with what is shall know truth. Contentment does not mean being satisfied with the status quo, maintaining things as they are&mdash;that is not contentment. It is in seeing a fact truly and being free of it that there is contentment, which is virtue.</p>
<p>Truth is not continuous, it has no abiding place, it can be seen only from moment to moment. Truth is always new, therefore timeless. What was truth yesterday is not truth today; what is truth today is not truth tomorrow: truth has no continuity. It is the mind which wants to make the experience which it calls truth continuous, and such a mind shall not know truth. Truth is always new; it is to see the same smile, and see that smile newly, to see the same person and see that person anew, to see the waving palms anew, to meet life anew. Truth is not to be had through books, through devotion, or through self- immolation, but it is known when the mind is free, quiet; and that freedom, that quietness of the mind, comes only when the facts of its relationships are understood. Without understanding its relationships, whatever it does only creates further problems. But when the mind is free from all its projections, there is a state of quietness in which problems cease, and then only the timeless, the eternal, comes into being. Then truth is not a matter of knowledge, it is not a thing to be remembered, it is not something to be repeated, to be printed and spread abroad. Truth is that which is; it is nameless, and so the mind cannot approach it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">What is this silence? Can it be described?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Since this state of silence seems to be a precondition to everything, would you please describe it in terms of what you do not mean by the word? What kind of activity do you not mean by silence? Approach it that way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wonder if we can’t approach the whole issue differently. I think most of us are aware that we are in a state of contradiction. One doesn’t have to go into the details of that contradiction. Because that contradiction causes pain, various forms of destructive activity, one says to oneself, “Is it possible to be free of all contradiction, not only conscious, but also unconscious contradiction?” That is the principal question. I want to learn about it; I do not want you to tell me what silence is, or what it is not, but I want to understand, I want to learn in the very process of observation. I observe that I am in a state of contradiction; and also I know very well that as long as there is a center, a form, an image, whatever it may be, it will always breed contradiction. Then what is the mind to do? How is it to learn about contradiction without creating another center which would in turn become a further source of contradiction? I see that I must have a certain passive, quiet, still awareness in order to learn, in order to understand anything. That passive awareness is not a thing which I can cultivate. To understand this vast stream of life which is myself, with my various centers&mdash;business, spiritual, family&mdash;is the act of silence itself.</p>
<p>What is this silence? You are not going to cultivate it by listening to me, getting a pattern of silence, or of what silence is not, and then working up in it and capturing the silence&mdash;you never can do that, obviously. What is this silence? Can it be described? If it is described, either positively or negatively, there is still an observer, there is still a center which looks at it as silence. That center creates contradiction by saying, “How am I to cultivate that silence?”</p>
<p>First of all, are we clear that the mind must be somewhat quiet if it would listen to that stream, if it would look at a tree, if it would look at another’s face? To look, to listen, to learn, there must be a certain quiet, there must be a certain passive attention&mdash;not a blankness, not a determined quietness, nor a cultivated quietness. If we inquire what that silence is, what that quietness is, we’ll invent images, symbols, words, which become the center.</p>
<p>What is this quietness? What is the nature and the structure of the silence itself, not the structure of the words which describe the silence? Please, again, let’s be very clear. You are not listening to me, trying to understand me, the speaker. The speaker is not at all important; what is important is to understand the nature and the structure of the mind which is quiet, and out of that quietness to learn and act. The learning is the acting.</p>

<p class="subtitle">You cannot come to it by practice, by saying, “I will first attempt to be aware, then choicelessly aware, then attentive, then silence.”</p>
<p>A mind that is groping after more experience, more excitement, more sensation&mdash;such a mind is not silent; and, therefore, it experiences only within the borders of its own conditioning and within its own knowledge. …</p>
<p>Silence is not only of thought but also of the brain. I will not go into all that; there is no time to go into all that. The brain, which is the nerves, the cells, everything, is quiet, but terribly awake, attentive&mdash;it must be. Then, because of this silence, there is space; and because there is space, there is love. You cannot come to it by practice, by saying, “I will first attempt to be aware, then choicelessly aware, then attentive, then silence.” Minds are so petty! You want it all on a blueprint, and all that you have to do is just to follow. It does not work like that. Either you see the whole thing, the whole beauty of the sunset, of the tree, and the whole beauty of this meditation, completely and at once, and therefore flow with it, or you do not see at all.</p>
<p>Then you will see that love does alter immediately every action of life. That is the only catalyst, the only thing&mdash;nothing else&mdash;that will bring about a total mutation of the mind. And we need such a mutation. Because man has lived so long in his misery, with the everyday torture of existence, the uncertainty, the confusion, the conflict, and the supposed meaninglessness of life. But there is an extraordinary meaning to living. Living&mdash;going to an office, talking to your wife, doing everything that you do&mdash;has tremendous meaning if you know how to look at it, how to come upon it. And to come upon it, to know it, to see the beauty of it&mdash;that can only take place when there is silence, when there is space and love. And that is truth, and that is the only thing that matters in life. Then all the heavens and all the hells are open. Then you do not have to seek God. Then you do not have to go to any temple or any church; you do not have to be a slave of any priest or of any book or of any authority. Then there is only light, and that light is love and silence.</p>

<hr class="separator">

<p class="subtitle">If the mind is totally aware in that quality of pure clarity, then out of that there is creation.</p>
<p>In meditation, there is no search for experience at all. Please follow all this. There is no search at all, not only for experience, but for every form of seeking, asking, questioning. Because only when there is no seeking and no asking, when there is no directive conditioning, when the brain has been sharpened to its highest sensitivity, when there is no sense of control but complete awareness, out of this comes the stillness of the mind&mdash;not the stillness that you are seeking, that you are cultivating. That is death, that is stagnation.</p>
<p>Out of this awareness of all that has been said till now during this evening&mdash;awareness of those crows, awareness of the speaker, awareness of your reactions to the speaker and the words he is using, choicelessly, negatively observing, being so totally aware&mdash;out of this awareness there is attention. You cannot attend if you are not silent. You listen to those crows, actually listen, give your attention&mdash;not resistance. Listen to those crows and listen to the speaker simultaneously, not two different things. And to pay complete attention to the crows and to the speaker, and to watch your own mind, how it is working, you need that attention which comes out of complete silence; otherwise, you are merely resisting the crows and trying to listen to the speaker. So there is a division, there is a conflict; so there is a pushing away, an exclusion&mdash; which is what most people do....</p>
<p>And it is only the mind that is completely aware that is completely attentive. And this attention and this awareness can only come when there is total stillness. That stillness is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of you have really taken the journey with the speaker so far; you have actually, factually, walked step by step on this journey until now. If you have done it, you will see that your mind is extraordinarily quiet. Please, I am not hypnotizing you&mdash;it is so immature, a trick of a clever charlatan. We are actually going through, actually living it: there is no pretension. Either you are there or you are not there. If you are not there, you have to begin right from the beginning, and go through it.</p>
<p>So, there is no sense of being hypnotized by somebody else, by his ideas or by his words or by your own longing to find the silence. It comes inevitably, as the sun rises in the east of a morning, when the mind has completely gone through all this and understood. Because it is the mature mind, the mind that is capable of looking at itself pitilessly&mdash;without any self-pity, without tears, without hope, without fear&mdash;the mind that is stark naked, that is capable of standing completely alone, not only in this world but in the psychological world which is inside the skin, without looking for anybody, for any support, for any way of conduct, to be encouraged.</p>
<p>If you have gone that far, then you will see the mind is completely silent. In that silence there is no reflection. When you look into a well which is rich with water and quietness, you see your own face; the reflection of your own face is there in the water, and you can go on improving that reflection ad nauseam, changing it, modifying it. In that silence there is no reflection; as there is no thinker, there is no thought. It is devoid of all experience, but it is tremendously alive; it is energy, not death, not decay.</p>
<p>Now, so far, we can use words up to there. But to go further into this extraordinary silence, you not only have to proceed nonverbally, nonabstractly, but actually. And you cannot proceed actually unless you have come, step by step, where we are now. Perhaps some of you have gone through it, and you now begin to understand the nature and the meaning of meditation, and so are able to be actually in that silence, unimagined, not provoked, not premeditated&mdash;it is there.</p>
<p>In that silence, there is no onlooker, there is no entity that says, “I am silent.” There is only silence, an immense space in which there is emptiness. Because, unless the mind is empty, it cannot possibly see the new. When the mind is empty&mdash;not induced emptiness&mdash;when there is the sense of complete void, which is alive, vibrating, strong, potent, not dormant, not a state of blankness, then you will see that there is quite a different movement of creation.</p>
<p>You may say, “Are you not, when you are talking about that silence, observing that silence?” What we are saying is merely the word, but not the thing. The word tree is not the tree. The speaker is only describing; the word, the description, is not the effect. Therefore, you can forget the word, forget the description, and be actually there.</p>
<p>If you are there, if the mind is totally aware in that quality of pure clarity, then out of that there is creation&mdash;creation not in the mundane sense of the word: painting a picture, writing a poem, creating the baby. Because the world is in a state of creation, the universe is, it is exploding. And only in that extraordinary silence which has no border, which has no depth, no height, no measures&mdash;out of this immense silence, one knows the origin, the beginning of all things.</p>

<h1>IX. In Summation</h1>
<p>During the last talks or discussions, we have been considering the question of self-knowledge. Because, as we said, without being aware of one’s own process of thought and feeling, it is obviously not possible to act rightly or think rightly. So, the essential purpose of these gatherings or discussions or meetings is really to see if one can, for oneself, directly experience the process of one’s own thinking and be aware of it integrally. Most of us are aware of it superficially, on the upper or superficial level of the mind, but not as a total process. It is this total process that gives freedom, that gives comprehension, that gives understanding, and not the partial process. Some of us may know ourselves partially, at least we think we know ourselves a little, but that little is not sufficient, because if one knows oneself slightly, it acts as a hindrance rather than a help. And it is only in knowing oneself as a total process&mdash;physiologically and psychologically, the hidden, unconscious, deeper layers as well as the superficial layers&mdash;it is only when we know the total process that we are able to deal with the problems that inevitably arise, not partially, but as a whole.</p>
<p>Now, this ability to deal with the total process is what I would like to discuss this evening, also whether it is a question of the cultivation of a particular capacity, which implies a certain kind of specialization. Does understanding, happiness, the realization of something beyond the mere physical sensations, come through any specialization? Because, capacity implies specialization. In a world of ever-increasing specialization, we depend on the specialists. If anything goes wrong with a car, we turn to the mechanic; if anything goes wrong physically, we go to a doctor. If there is a psychological maladjustment, we run, if we have the money and the means, to a psychologist, or to a priest, and so on. That is, we look to the specialist for help in our failures and miseries.</p>
<p>Now, does the understanding of ourselves demand specialization? The specialist knows only his specialty at whatever level. And does the knowledge of ourselves demand specialization? I do not think so; on the contrary. Specialization implies, does it not?, a narrowing-down of the whole, total process of our being to a particular point and specializing on that point. Since we have to understand ourselves as a total process, we cannot specialize. Because, specialization implies exclusion, obviously, whereas to know ourselves does not demand any kind of exclusion; on the contrary, it demands a complete awareness of ourselves as an integral process and, for that, specialization is a hindrance.</p>
<p>After all, what is it that we have to do? Know ourselves, which means to know our relationship with the world, surely&mdash;not only with the world of ideas and people, but also with nature, with the things we possess. That is our life&mdash;life being relationship to the whole. And does the understanding of that relationship demand specialization? Obviously not. What it demands is awareness to meet life as a whole. How is one to be aware? That is our problem. How is one to have that awareness, if I may use this word without making it mean specialization? How is one to be capable of meeting life as a whole? Which means not only personal relationship with your neighbor, but also with nature, with the things that you possess, with ideas, and with the things that the mind manufactures as illusion, desire, and so on. How is one to be aware of this whole process of relationship? Surely, that is our life, is it not? There is no life without relationship, and to understand this relationship does not mean isolation, as I have been insisting, constantly explaining; on the contrary, it demands a full recognition or awareness of the total process of relationship.</p>
<p>Now, how is one to be aware? How are we aware of anything? How are you aware of your relationship with a person? How are you aware of these trees, the calling of that cow? How are you aware of your reactions when you read a newspaper, if you read a newspaper? And, are we aware of the superficial responses of the mind as well as the inner responses? How are we aware of anything? Surely, first we are aware, are we not?, of a response to a stimulus, which is an obvious fact: I see the trees, and there is a response, then sensation, contact, identification, and desire. That is the ordinary process, isn’t it? We can observe what actually takes place without studying any books.</p>
<p>So, through identification, you have pleasure and pain. And our “capacity” is this concern with pleasure and the avoidance of pain, is it not? If you are interested in something, if it gives you pleasure, there is capacity immediately; there is an awareness of that fact immediately and, if it is painful, the capacity is developed to avoid it. So, as long as we are looking to capacity to understand ourselves, I think we shall fail, because the understanding of ourselves does not depend on capacity; it is not a technique that you develop, cultivate, and increase through time, through constantly sharpening. This awareness of oneself can be tested, surely, in the action of relationship; it can be tested in the way we talk, the way we behave. Watch yourself after the meeting is over, watch yourself at table&mdash;just observe, without any identification, without any comparison, without any condemnation&mdash;just watch, and you will see an extraordinary thing taking place. You not only put an end to an activity which is unconscious&mdash;because most of our activities are unconscious&mdash;you not only bring that to an end but, further, you are aware of the motives of that action without inquiry, without digging into it.</p>
<p>Now, when you are aware, you see the whole process of your thinking and action, but it can happen only when there is no condemnation. That is, when I condemn something, I do not understand it, and it is one way of avoiding any kind of understanding. I think most of us do that purposely; we condemn immediately, and we think we have understood. If we do not condemn but regard it, are aware of it, then the content, the significance of that action begins to open up. Experiment with this and you will see for yourself. Just be aware&mdash;without any sense of justification&mdash;which may appear rather negative, but is not negative; on the contrary, it has the quality of passivity which is direct action, and you will discover this if you experiment with it.</p>
<p>After all, if you want to understand something, you have to be in a passive mood, do you not? You cannot keep on thinking about it, speculating about it, or questioning it. You have to be sensitive enough to receive the content of it; it is like being a sensitive photographic plate. If I want to understand you, I have to be passively aware, then you begin to tell me all of your story. Surely, that is not a question of capacity or specialization. In that process, we begin to understand ourselves&mdash;not only the superficial layers of our consciousness, but the deeper, which is much more important, because there are all of our motives or intentions, our hidden, confused demands, anxieties, fears, appetites. Outwardly we may have them all under control, but inwardly they are boiling. Until those have been completely understood through awareness, obviously there cannot be freedom, there cannot be happiness, there is no intelligence.</p>
<p>So, is intelligence a matter of specialization?&mdash;intelligence being the total awareness of our process. And is that intelligence to be cultivated through any form of specialization? Because, that is what is happening, is it not? You are listening to me, probably thinking that I am a specialist&mdash;I hope not. The priest, the doctor, the engineer, the industrialist, the businessman, the professor&mdash;we have the mentality of all that specialization. And we think that to realize the highest form of intelligence&mdash;which is truth, which is God, which cannot be described&mdash;to realize that, we have to make ourselves specialists. We study, we grope, we search out, and with the mentality of the specialist, or looking to the specialist, we study ourselves in order to develop a capacity which will help to unravel our conflicts, our miseries.</p>
<p>So, our problem is, if we are at all aware, whether the conflicts and the miseries and the sorrows of our daily existence can be solved by another, and if they cannot, how is it possible for us to tackle them? To understand a problem obviously requires a certain intelligence, and that intelligence cannot be derived from or cultivated through specialization. It comes into being only when we are passively aware of the whole process of our consciousness, which is to be aware of ourselves without choice, without choosing what is right and what is wrong. Because, when you are passively aware, you will see that out of that passivity&mdash; which is not idleness, which is not sleep, but extreme alertness&mdash;the problem has quite a different significance, which means there is no longer identification with the problem, and therefore there is no judgment, and hence the problem begins to reveal its content. If you are able to do that constantly, continuously, then every problem can be solved fundamentally, not superficially. And that is the difficulty, because most of us are incapable of being passively aware, letting the problem tell the story without our interpreting it. We do not know how to look at a problem dispassionately&mdash;if you like to use that word. Unfortunately, we are not capable of doing that because we want a result from the problem, we want an answer, we are looking to an end; or, we try to translate the problem according to our pleasure or pain; or, we have an answer already, how to deal with the problem. Therefore, we approach a problem, which is always new, with the old pattern. The challenge is always the new, but our response is always the old, and our difficulty is to meet the challenge adequately, that is, fully. The problem is always a problem of relationship: there is no other problem. And, to meet the problem of relationship, with its constantly varying demands&mdash;to meet it rightly, to meet it adequately&mdash;one has to be aware, passively, and this passivity is not a question of determination, of will, of discipline. To be aware that we are not passive is the beginning; to be aware that we want a particular answer to a particular problem, surely that is the beginning: to know ourselves in relationship to the problem and how we deal with the problem. Then, as we begin to know ourselves in relationship to the problem&mdash;how we respond, what are our various prejudices, demands, pursuits, in meeting that problem&mdash; this awareness will reveal the process of our own thinking, of our own inward nature, and in that there is a release.</p>
<p>So, life is a matter of relationship, and to understand that relationship, which is not static, there must be an awareness which is pliable, an awareness which is alertly passive, not aggressively active. And, as I said, this passive awareness does not come through any form of discipline, through any practice. It is to be just aware, from moment to moment, of our thinking and feeling, not only when we are awake, for we will see, as we go into it deeper, that we begin to dream, that we begin to throw up all kinds of symbols which we translate as dreams. So, we open the door into the hidden, which becomes the known. But, to find the unknown, we must go beyond the door; surely, that is our difficulty. Reality is not a thing that is knowable by the mind, because the mind is the result of the known, of the past; therefore, the mind must understand itself and its functioning, its truth, and only then is it possible for the unknown to be.</p>

<h1>Other Krishnamurti Titles</h1>
<p><b>Krishnamurti’s Notebook</b></p>
<p>When Krishnamurti’s Notebook first became available in 1976, it was soon realized that it was a spiritually unique document giving his perceptions and experiences and describing his states of consciousness. “The words inside offer the intimate spirit of a truly remarkable presence, poetic, gracious, vast as the sky and wonderfully wise.” ~ Jack Kornfield ISBN: 1-888004-57-6(cloth) 1-888004-63-0(paper) • 387 pp • KPA</p>


<p><b>Commentaries on Living: I, II, III</b></p>
<p>While many of Krishnamurti’s books are compilations of his talks, Commentaries on Living was written by Krishnamurti at the request of his good friend Aldous Huxley. The three-part series is among the easiest of Krishnamurti’s works to read, blending descriptions of nature with explorations into the psychological problems that beset human beings.</p>
<p>Series I: ISBN 0-8356-0390-3 • 254 pp • Quest Series II: 0-8356-0415-2 • 242 pp • Quest Series III: 0-8356-0402-0 • 312 pp • Quest</p>


<p><b>Think on These Things</b></p>
<p>Think on These Things has sold more than 3 million copies (the most popular Krishnamurti book ever published) and has been printed worldwide in 22 languages. According to Krishnamurti, real culture is neither a matter of breeding nor of learning, nor of talent, nor even of genius, but is “the timeless movement to find happiness, God, truth.” And, “when this movement is blocked by authority, by tradition, by fear, there is decay.” ISBN 0-06-091609-5 • 258 pp • Harper Perennial</p>


<p><b>The Book of Life: Daily Meditations with Krishnamurti</b></p>
<p>Inspired by Krishnamurti’s perception that truth can be discovered by anyone and that all life is interconnected, The Book of Life presents passages from Krishnamurti’s talks and writings on a different theme for every week of the year, with each topic examined over seven days. Topics include: self-knowledge, desire, sorrow, death, meditation, fear, energy, feelings, violence, rebirth, god, truth, grief, authority, and belief. ISBN: 0-06-064879-1 • 388 pp • HarperSanFrancisco</p>


<p><b>Education &amp; the Significance of Life</b></p>
<p>Krishnamurti examines what is true education and what is wrong with modern education, relating it to society at large and the need for a new and different world order. The book speaks of such matters as class size and the function of leadership, while never losing the central vision that “true culture is founded on the educators.” ISBN: 0-06-064876-7 • 125 • HarperSanFrancisco</p>

<p><b>The Whole Movement of Life is Learning</b> <i>Krishnamurti’s Letters to His Schools</i></p>
<p>This new collection combines Krishnamurti’s letters to schools originally published in Volume I (1981) and Volume II (1985) with seventeen originally unpublished letters from earlier years. In the letters, written regularly to the people responsible for running the Krishnamurti schools around the world, he expresses with great diligence and energy his hopes for these schools. Evident in these writings is his urgency to provide schools which go beyond mere “mechanical process oriented to a career,” instead dedicating themselves to “cultivation of the total human being”. The insights in these letters will be valued by parents, educators, students, and others concerned about the failure of educational systems to nurture the full development of young people. ISBN: 9-09005-060-9 • 262 pp • KFT</p>

<p><b>The Awakening of Intelligence</b></p>
<p>This book is a “must-read” for any person interested in Krishnamurti’s teachings. It contains discussions with scholars and scientists including Professor Jacob Needleman, Alain Naudé, Swami Venkatesananda, and David Bohm. Of particular interest is an entire section where Swami Venkatesananda questions Krishnamurti on traditional Vedanta methods, inviting him to scrutinize the paths of the four Yogas. ISBN: 0-06-064834-1 • 538 pp • HarperSanFrancisco</p>

<p><b>Freedom from the Known</b></p>
<p>Drawn from a number of Krishnamurti’s talks and dialogues, Freedom from the Known explores many of the central themes of his teaching. Chapters include: Learning About Ourselves, The Pursuit of Pleasure, Justification and Condemnation, and The Dissipation of Energy. The vital need for change and the possibility of it are the essence of what Krishnamurti has to</p>
<p>communicate in this book. Krishnamurti says, “The man who is really serious, with the urge to find out what truth is, what love is, has no concept at all. He lives only in what is.” ISBN: 0-06-064808-2 • 124 pp • HarperSanFrancisco</p>


<p><b>Inward Revolution: Bringing About Radical Change in the World</b></p>
<p>In Inward Revolution, Krishnamurti inquires with the reader into how remembering and dwelling on past events, both pleasurable and painful, give us a false sense of continuity, causing us to suffer. His challenge is to be attentive and clear in our perceptions and to meet the challenges of life directly in each new moment. ISBN: 1-59030-327-X • 230 pp • Shambhala</p>
