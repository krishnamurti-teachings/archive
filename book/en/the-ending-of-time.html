<p>This book has been prepared from Dialogues that took place between J. Krishnamurti and Professor David Bohm in America and in England between April and September, 1980. On certain occasions other people were present, and their occasional contributions to the discussions, unless otherwise stated, are attributed to ‘Questioner’ rather than to individuals by name.</p>

<h1>1. The Roots of Psychological Conflict</h1>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How shall we start? I would like to ask if humanity has taken a wrong turn.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>A wrong turn? Well it must have done so, a long time ago, I think.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I feel. A long time ago... It appears that way - why? You see, as I look at it, mankind has always tried to become something.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well possibly. I was struck by something I once read about man going wrong about five or six thousand years ago, when he began to be able to plunder and take slaves. After that, his main purpose of existence was just to exploit and plunder.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but there is the sense of inward becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we should make it clear how this is connected. What kind of becoming was involved in doing that? Instead of being constructive, and discovering new techniques and tools and so on, man at a certain time found it easier to plunder his neighbours. Now what did they want to become?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Conflict has been the root of all this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What was the conflict? If we could put ourselves in the place of those people of long ago, how would you see that conflict?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is the root of conflict? Not only outwardly, but also this tremendous inward conflict of humanity? What is the root of it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it seems that it is contradictory desires.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Is it that in all religions, you must become something? You must reach something?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then what made people want to do that? Why weren’t they satisfied to be whatever they were? You see, the religion would not have caught on unless people felt that there was some attraction in becoming something more.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Isn’t it an avoidance, not being able to face the fact, and therefore moving to something else - to more and more and more?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What would you say was the fact that people couldn’t stay with?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The Christians have said, Original Sin.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But the wrong turn happened long before that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, long before that. Long before that, the Hindus had this idea of Karma. What is the origin of all this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have said that there was the fact that people couldn’t stay with. Whatever it was, they wanted to imagine something better.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, something better. Becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And you could say that they began to make things technologically better, then they extended this, and said, ‘I too must become better.’</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, inwardly become better.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All of us together must become better.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. What is the root of all this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I should think it is natural in thought to project this goal of becoming better. That is, it is intrinsic in the structure of thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it that the principle of becoming better outwardly has moved to becoming better inwardly?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If it is good to become better outwardly, then why shouldn’t I become better inwardly?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that the cause of the conflict?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is getting towards it. It’s coming nearer.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it coming nearer? Is time the factor? Time - as ‘I need knowledge in order to do this or that’? The same principle applied inwardly? Is time the factor?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I can’t see that time by itself can be the only factor.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. Time. Becoming - which implies time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but we don’t see how time is going to cause trouble. We have to say that time applied outwardly doesn’t cause any difficulty.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It causes a certain amount - but we are discussing the idea of time, inwardly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So we have to see why time is so destructive inwardly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because I am trying to become something.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but most people would say that this is only natural. You have to explain what it is that is wrong about becoming.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously, there is conflict, in that when I am trying to become something, it is a constant battle.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Can we go into that: why is it a constant battle? It is not a battle if I try to improve my position outwardly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Outwardly, no. It is more or less all right outwardly, but when that same principle is applied inwardly it brings about a contradiction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And the contradiction is...?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Between ‘what is’ and ‘becoming what should be’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The difficulty is, why is it a contradiction inwardly and not outwardly?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Inwardly it builds up a centre, doesn’t it, an egotistic centre?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but can we find some reason why it should do so? Does it build up when we do it outwardly? It seems it need not.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It need not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But when we are doing it inwardly, then we are trying to force ourselves to be something that we are not.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That is a fact. Is it that one’s brain is so accustomed to conflict that one rejects any other form of living?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But why have people come to the conclusion that conflict is inevitable and necessary?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is the origin of conflict?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think we touched on that by saying that we are trying to force ourselves. When we are a certain thing that we want to be, we also want to be something else, which is different; and therefore we want two different things at the same time. Would that seem right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand that. But I am trying to find out the origin of all this misery, confusion, conflict, struggle - what is the beginning of it? That’s why I asked at the beginning: has mankind taken a wrong turn? Is the origin, ‘I am not I’...?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that is getting closer.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s it. And the ‘I’ - why has mankind created this ‘I’, which must, inevitably, cause conflict? ‘I’ and ‘you’, and ‘I’ better than ‘you’, and so on, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think it was a mistake made a long time ago, or, as you call it, a wrong turn, that having introduced separation between various things outwardly, we then kept on doing it - not out of ill will but simply through not knowing better.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not seeing what we were doing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that the origin of all this conflict?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I am not sure that it is the origin. What do you feel?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am inclined to observe that the origin is the ego, the ‘me’, the ‘I’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If there is no ego, there is no problem, there is no conflict, there is no time - time in the sense of becoming or not becoming; being or not being.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it might be that we would still slip into whatever it was that made us make the ego in the first place.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait a minute. Is it that energy - being so vast, limitless - has been condensed or narrowed down in the mind, and the brain itself has become narrowed because it couldn’t contain all this enormous energy? You are following what I am saying?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And therefore the brain has gradually narrowed down to ‘me’, to the ‘I’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I don’t quite follow that. I understand that that is what happened, but I don’t quite see all the steps. You say energy was enormous and the brain couldn’t handle it, or decided that it couldn’t handle it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It couldn’t handle it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But if it can’t handle it, it seems as if there is no way out.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, just a minute. Go slowly. I just want to enquire, push into it a little bit. Why has the brain, with all thought, created this sense of ‘me’, ‘I’? Why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We needed a certain sense of identity to function.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, to function.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>To know where we belong.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And is that the movement which has brought the ‘me’? The movement of the outer? I had to identify, with the family, the house, the trade or profession. All this gradually became the ‘me’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that this energy that you are talking about also entered into it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but I want to lead up to that slowly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, what you say is right, that in some way this sense of the ‘me’ gradually strengthened, but by itself that wouldn’t explain the tremendous strength that the ego has. It would only be a habit then. The ego becoming completely dominant required that it should become the focus of the greatest energy; of all the energy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that it? That the brain cannot hold this vast energy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s say that the brain is trying to control this - to bring it to order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Energy has no order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But if the brain feels it can’t control something that is going on inside, it will try to establish order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Could we say that the brain, your brain, his brain, her brain, has not just been born; it is very, very old?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In what sense?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In the sense that it has evolved.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Evolved, yes, from the animal. And the animal has evolved. So let’s say that in a sense this whole evolution is somehow contained in the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want to question evolution. I understand, say, evolution from the bullock cart to the jet.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. But before you question, we have to consider the evidence of man developing through a series of stages. You can’t question that, can you?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, of course not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I mean, physically it is clear that evolution has occurred in some way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Physically, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And the brain has got larger, more complex. But you may question whether mentally evolution has any meaning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, I want to abolish time, psychologically. You understand?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To me that is the enemy. And is that the cause, the origin of man’s misery?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This use of time, certainly. Man had to use time for a certain purpose, but he misused it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand that. If I have to learn a language, I must have time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But the misuse of time by extending it inwardly...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Inwardly: that is what I am talking about. Is that the cause of man’s confusion - introducing time as a means of becoming, and becoming more and more perfect, more and more evolved, more and more loving? You follow what I mean?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I understand. Certainly if we didn’t do that, the whole structure would collapse.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I don’t know whether there is not some other cause.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Just a minute. I want to go into that a little bit. I am not talking theoretically, personally. But to me the idea of tomorrow doesn’t exist psychologically - that is, time as a movement, either inwardly or outwardly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You mean psychological time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, psychological time, and time outwardly. Now if psychological time doesn’t exist, then there is no conflict, there is no ‘me’, no ‘I’, which is the origin of conflict. Outwardly, technologically man has moved, evolved.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And also in the inward physical structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The structure, everything. But psychologically we have also moved outward.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, we have focused our life on the outward. Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. We have extended our capacities outwardly. And inwardly it is the same movement as outwardly. Now if there is no inward movement as time, moving, becoming more and more, then what takes place? You understand what I am trying to convey? Time ends. You see, the outer movement is the same as the inward movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. It is going around and around.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Involving time. If the movement ceases, then what takes place? I wonder if I am conveying anything? Could we put it this way? We have never touched any other movement than the outer movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Generally, anyway. We put most of our energy into the outer movements.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And psychological movement is also outward.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it is the reflection of that outward movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We think it is inward but it is actually outward, right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now if that movement ends, as it must, then is there a really inward movement - a movement not in terms of time?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You are asking, is there another kind of movement which still moves, but not in terms of time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to go into that. Could you go further?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, that word movement means time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it really means to change from one place to another. But anyway there is still the notion of something which is not static. By denying time you don’t want to return to something static, which is still time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s say, for instance, that one’s brain has been trained, accustomed, for centuries to go North. And it suddenly realizes that going North means everlasting conflict. As it realizes that, the brain itself changes - the quality of the brain changes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All right. I can see it will wake up in some way to a different movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, different.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Is the word flow any better?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I have been going North all my life, and there is a sudden stoppage from going North. But the brain is not going East or South or West. Then conflict ceases - right? Because it is not moving in any direction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So that is the key point - the direction of movement. When the movement is fixed in direction, inwardly, it will come to conflict. But outwardly we need a fixed direction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course we do. That’s understood.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. So if we say the brain has no fixed direction, then what is it doing? Is it moving in all directions?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am a little bit hesitant to talk about this. Could one say, when one really comes to that state, that it is the source of all energy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, as one goes deeper and more inward.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>This is the real inwardness; not the outward movement becoming the inner movement, but no outer or inner movement...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, we can deny both the outward and the inner, so that all movement would seem to stop.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would that be the source of all energy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, perhaps we could say that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>May I talk about myself a little bit?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First about meditation. All conscious meditation is no meditation - right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What do you mean by conscious meditation?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Deliberate, practised meditation, which is really premeditated meditation. Is there a meditation which is not premeditated - which is not the ego trying to become something - or being able to negate?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Before we go ahead, could we suggest what meditation should be? Is it an observation of the mind observing?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. It has gone beyond all that. I am using the word meditation in the sense in which there is not a particle of any sense of trying consciously to become, to reach a level.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The mind is simply with itself, silent.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I want to get at.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not looking for anything.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, I don’t meditate in the normal sense of the word. What happens is that I wake up meditating.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In that state?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>One night in India I woke up; it was a quarter past twelve, I looked at the watch. And - I hesitate to say this because it sounds extravagant - the source of all energy had been reached. And that had an extraordinary effect on the brain. And also physically. I’m sorry to talk about myself but, you understand, literally, there was no division at all; no sense of the world, of ‘me’. You follow? Only this sense of a tremendous source of energy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So the brain was in contact with this source of energy?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, and as I have been talking for sixty years, I would like others to reach this - no, not reach it. You understand what I am saying? All our problems are solved. Because it is pure energy from the very beginning of time. Now how am I - not ‘I’, you understand - how is one not to teach, not to help, or push - but how is one to say, ‘This way leads to a complete sense of peace, of love’? I am sorry to use all these words. But suppose you have come to that point and your brain itself is throbbing with it - how would you help another? You understand? Help - not words. How would you help another to come to that? You understand what I am trying to say?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>My brain - but not mine - has evolved. Evolution implies time, and it can only think, live in time. Now for the brain to deny time is a tremendous activity, for any problem that arises, any question is immediately solved.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Is this situation sustained or is it only for a period?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is sustained, obviously, otherwise there is no point in it. It is not sporadic or intermittent. Now how are you to open the door, how are you to help another to say, ‘Look, we have been going in the wrong direction, there is only non-movement; and, if movement stops, everything will be correct’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it is hard to know beforehand if everything is going to be correct.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s go back to what we began with. That is, has mankind taken a wrong turn, psychologically, not physically? Can that turn be completely reversed? Or stopped? My brain is so accustomed to this evolutionary idea that I will become something, I will gain something, that I must have more knowledge and so on; can that brain suddenly realize that there is no such thing as time? You understand what I am trying to say?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I was listening the other day to a discussion on television about Darwin, his knowledge and what he achieved - his whole theory of evolution. It seems to me that this is totally untrue psychologically.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems that he has given evidence that all species have changed in time. Why is that untrue?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. It is obvious.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is true in one respect, although I think it would be untrue to say the mind evolved in time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But physically it seems clear there has been a process of evolution, and that this has increased the capacity of the brain to do certain things. For example, we couldn’t be discussing this if the brain had not grown larger.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I think you are implying that the mind is not originating in the brain. Is that so? The brain is perhaps an instrument of the mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And the mind is not time. Just see what that means.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The mind does not evolve with the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The mind not being of time, and the brain being of time - is that the origin of conflict?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we have to see why that produces conflict. It is not clear to say that the brain is of time, but rather that it has developed in such a way that time is in it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is what I meant.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But not necessarily so.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It has evolved.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It has evolved, so it has time within it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, it has evolved, time is part of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It has become part of its very structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>However, the mind operates without time, although the brain is not able to do so.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That means that God is in man, and God can only operate if the brain is quiet, if the brain is not caught in time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I wasn’t meaning that. I see that the brain, having a structure of time, is not able to respond properly to mind. That’s really what seems to be involved here.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can the brain itself see that it is caught in time, and that as long as it is moving in that direction, conflict is eternal, endless? You follow what I am saying?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Does the brain see it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Has the brain the capacity to see in what it is doing now - being caught in time - that in that process there is no end to conflict? That means, is there a part of the brain which is not of time?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not caught or functioning in time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can one say that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I don’t know.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That would mean - we come back to the same thing in different words - that the brain is not being completely conditioned by time, so there is a part of the brain that is free of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not a part, but rather that the brain is mainly dominated by time, although that doesn’t necessarily mean it couldn’t shift.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That is, can the brain, dominated by time, not be subservient to it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s right. In that moment it comes out of time. I think I can see this - it is dominated only when you give it time. Thought which takes time is dominated, but anything fast enough is not dominated.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s right. Can the brain - which has been used to time - can it see in that process that there is no end to conflict? See, in the sense of realizing this? Will it realize it under pressure? Certainly not. Will it realize it under coercion, reward or punishment? It will not. It will either resist or escape.</p>
<p>So what is the factor that will make the brain see that the way it has been functioning is not correct? (Let’s use that word for the moment.) And what will make it suddenly realize that it is totally mischievous? What will make it? Certainly not drugs or some kind of chemical.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>None of these outward things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then what will make the brain realize this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What do you mean by realize?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Realize that the path along which the brain has been going will always be the path of conflict.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think this raises the question that the brain resists such a realization.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course. Because it has been used to the old path, for centuries! How will you make the brain realize this fact? If you could make it realize that, conflict is finished.</p>
<p>You see, people have tried fasting, austerity, poverty, chastity in the real sense, purity, having a mind that is absolutely correct; they have tried going away by themselves; they have tried practically everything that man has invented, but none of these ways has succeeded.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, what do you say? It is clear that people pursuing these outward goals are still becoming.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but they never realize that these are outward goals. It means denying all that completely.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, to go further, I think that one has to deny the very notion of time in the sense of looking forward to the future, and deny all the past.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is, the whole of time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Time is the enemy. Meet it, and go beyond it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Deny that it has an independent existence. You see, I think we have the impression that time exists independently of us. We are in the stream of time, and therefore it would seem absurd for us to deny it because that is what we are.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, quite, quite. So it means really moving away - again this is only words - from everything that man has put together as a means of timelessness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Can we say that none of the methods that man uses outwardly is going to free the mind from time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Absolutely.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Every method implies time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. It is so simple.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We start out immediately by setting up the whole structure of time; the whole notion of time is presupposed before we start.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, quite. But how will you convey this to another? How will you, or ‘X’, convey this to a man who is caught in time and will resist it, fight it, because he says there is no other way? How will you convey this to him?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that you can only convey it to somebody who has gone into it; you are not likely to convey it at all to somebody you just pick up off the street!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So then, what are we doing? As that cannot be conveyed through words, what is a man to do? Would you say that to resolve a problem as it arises you have to go into it immediately, because otherwise you may do the most foolish thing and delude yourself that you have resolved it? Suppose I have a problem, any psychological problem - can the mind realize, resolve it immediately? Not deceive itself, not resist it - you understand? But face it, and end it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, with a psychological problem, that is the only way. Otherwise we would be caught in the very source of the problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Would that activity end time, the psychological time that we are talking about?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, if we could bring this immediate action to bear on the problem, which is the self.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>One is greedy, or envious. To end immediately greed, attachment, and so on, will that not give a clue to the ending of time?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, because any action which is not immediate has already brought in time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, yes. I know that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The ending of time is immediate - right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Immediate, of course. Would that point out the wrong turn that mankind has taken?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, if man feels something is out of order psychologically he then brings in the notion of time, and the thought of becoming, and that creates endless problems.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would that open the door to this sense of time having no place inwardly? Which means, doesn’t it, that thought has no place except outwardly?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You are saying that thought is a process which is involved in time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wouldn’t you say that thought is the process of time? Because thought is based on experience, knowledge, memory and response, which is the whole of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s try to put it that thought, as we have generally known it, is in time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Thought as we know it now is of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. I would agree, generally speaking.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Generally speaking, thought is time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is based on the notion of time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, all right. But to me, thought itself is time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Thought itself creates time, right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Does it mean, when there is no time there is no thought?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well no thought of that kind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. There is no thought. I want just to go slowly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Could we say that there is a kind of thought which we have lived in which has been dominated by time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but that has come to an end.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But there may be another kind of thought which is not dominated by time... I mean, you were saying, you could still use thought to do some things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, outwardly that’s so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to be careful not to say that thought is necessarily dominated by time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I have to go from here to there, to my house; that needs time, thought, but I am not talking of that kind of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So let’s make it clear that you are talking of thought which is aimed at the mind, whose content is the order of the mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Would you say knowledge is time?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, yes...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All knowledge is time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, in that it has been known, and may project into the future, and so on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, the future, the past. Knowledge - science, mathematics, whatever it is - is acquired through time. I read philosophy, I read this or that, and the whole movement of knowledge involves time. See what I mean!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think we are saying that man has taken a wrong turn and got caught in this kind of knowledge, which is dominated by time because it has become psychological knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So he lives in time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>He lives in time because he has attempted to produce knowledge of the nature of the mind. Are you saying that there is no real knowledge of the mind? Would you put it that way?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The moment you use the word ‘knowledge’, it implies time. When you end time, in the sense we are talking about, there is no knowledge as experience.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to see what the word ‘experience’ means.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Experience, memory.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>People say, ‘I learn by experience, I go through something.’</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which is becoming!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, let’s get it clear. You see there is a kind of experience, for example, in one’s job, which becomes skill and perception.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, but that is quite different.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But we are saying there is no point in having experience of the mind, psychological experience.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, let’s put it that way. Psychological experience is in time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and it has no point, because you cannot say, ‘As I become skilled in my job I will become skilled in my mind, or skilled fundamentally’.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So where is this leading? I realize that knowledge is time; the brain realizes it, and sees the importance of time in a certain direction, and that there is no value in time at all in another direction. It is not a contradiction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I would put it that the value of time is limited to a certain direction or area, and beyond that, it has no value.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So what is the mind or the brain without knowledge? You understand.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Without psychological knowledge?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I am talking psychologically.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not so much that it is caught in time as that it is without psychological knowledge to organize itself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So we are saying that the brain field must organize itself by knowing psychologically all about itself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is then the mind, the brain, disorder? Certainly not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No. But I think that people being faced with this might feel there would be disorder.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think what you are saying is that the notion of controlling yourself psychologically has no meaning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So knowledge of the ‘me’ - the psychological knowledge - is time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I understand the totality of knowledge is ‘me’, is time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So then what is existence without this? There is no time, there is no knowledge in the psychological sense, no sense of ‘me’, then what is there? To come to that point most people would say, ‘What a horror this is.’</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, because it seems there would be nothing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Nothing. But if one has come to that point, what is there? Would you say, because there is nothing, it is everything?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I would accept that. I know that. That is true, it has all.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No meditation, nothing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No thing, that’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>A thing is limited, and this is not a thing because there are no limits... At least, it has everything in potential.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait, Sir. If it is nothing, and so everything, so everything is energy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. The ground of everything is energy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Everything is energy. And what is the source of this thing? Or is there no source of energy at all? Is there only energy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Energy just is. Energy is ‘what is’. There is no need for a source. That is one approach, perhaps?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. If there is nothing, and therefore everything, and everything is energy... We must be very careful because here, the Hindus have this idea too, which is that Brahman is everything. You understand? But that becomes an idea, a principle, and then functioning is once more in the brain. But the fact of it is, there is nothing, therefore there is everything, and all that is cosmic energy. But what started this energy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We are not talking of time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know we are not talking of time, but you see the Christians would say, ‘God is energy and He is the source of all energy.’ No?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But the Christians have an idea of what they call the Godhead, which is the very source of God too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And also the Hindus, the Arabic and the Jewish worlds have this. Are we going against all that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It sounds similar in some ways.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And yet not similar. We must be careful.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Many things like this have been said over the ages.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then is one just walking in emptiness? Is one living in emptiness?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that is not clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is nothing, and everything is energy. What is this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, is there something within the energy?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>This is not different from energy. This. But the thing that is inside says, ‘I am totally different from that’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The ‘I’ encloses itself and says, ‘I am different, I am eternal.’</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why has it done this? Why has the separation arisen? Is it because outwardly I identify with a house and so on, and that identification has moved inwardly?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. And the second point was that once we established a notion of something inward, then it became necessary to protect that. And therefore that built up the separation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The inward was obviously the most precious thing, and it would have to be protected with all our energy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Does it mean then that there is only the organism - which part of energy? There is no ‘me’ at all, except the passport name and form; otherwise nothing. And therefore there is everything, and therefore all is energy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the form has no independent existence.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. There is only the form. That’s all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is also the energy, you say.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is part of energy. So there is only this, the outward shape.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is the outward form in the energy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Do you realize what we have said, Sir? Is this the end of the journey?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, I should think not.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Has mankind journeyed through millennia to come to this? That I am nothing, and therefore I am everything, and all energy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well it can’t be the end, in the sense that it might be the beginning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait. That is all I wanted you to begin with. The ending is the beginning - right? Now I want to go into that. You see, in the ending of all this - the ending of time, we will call it briefly - there is a new beginning. What is that? Because otherwise this seems so utterly futile. I am all energy and just the shell exists, and time has ended. It seems so futile.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, if we stop there...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that really this is clearing the ground of all the debris, of all the confusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So the ending is a beginning. But what is that? Beginning implies time also.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not necessarily. I think we said there could be a movement which had no time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is all. I want to make it clear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but it is hard to express. It is not a question of being static, but in some sense the movement has not the order of time. I think we would have to say that now.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So we will use the word ‘beginning’ and deprive it of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because ending and beginning are no special time. In fact they can be any time or no time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No time. Then what takes place? What is happening? Not to me, not to my brain. What is happening? We have said that when one denies time there is nothing. After this long talk, nothing means everything. Everything is energy. And we have stopped there. But that isn’t the end.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is not the end. Then what is going on? Is that creation?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, something like that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But not the art of creating like writing or painting.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps later we can discuss what we mean by creating.</p>

<h1>2. Cleansing the Mind of the Accumulation of Time</h1>

<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We were saying that psychological time is conflict, that time is the enemy of man. And that enemy has existed from the beginning of man. And we asked, why has man from the beginning taken a ‘wrong turn’, a ‘wrong path’? And, if so, is it possible to turn man in another direction in which he can live without conflict? Because, as we said yesterday, the outer movement is also the same as the inner movement. There is no separation between inner and outer. It is the same movement. And we asked whether we were concerned deeply and passionately to turn man in another direction so that he doesn’t live in time, with a knowledge only of the outer things. The religions, the politicians, the educators have failed: they have never been concerned about this. Would you agree to that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>Yes. I think the religions have tried to discuss the eternal values beyond time but they don’t seem to have succeeded.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I want to get at. To them it has been an idea, an ideal, a principle, a value, but not an actuality, and most of the religious people have their anchor in a belief, in a principle, in an image, in knowledge, in Jesus or in something or other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but if you were to consider all the religions, say the various forms of Buddhism, they try to say this very thing which you are saying, to some extent.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To some extent but what I am trying to get at is: why has man never confronted this problem? Why haven’t we said ‘Let’s end conflict’? Instead we have been encouraged because through conflict we think there is progress.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It can be a certain source of stimulus to try to overcome opposition.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, Sir, but if you and I see the truth of this, not in abstraction, but actually, deeply, can we act in such a way that every issue is resolved instantly, immediately, so that psychological time is abolished? And as we asked yesterday, when you come to that point where there is nothing and there is everything, where all that is energy - when time ends, is there a beginning of something totally new? Is there a beginning which is not enmeshed in time? Now how shall we discover it? Words are necessary to communicate. But the word is not that thing. So what is there when all time ends? Psychological time, not time of...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...time of day.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Time as the ‘me’, the ego, and when that completely comes to an end, what is there that begins? Could we say that out of the ashes of time there is a new growth? What is that which begins - no, that word ‘begins’ implies time too.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Whatever we mean, that which arises.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That arises, what is it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, as we said yesterday, essentially it is creation, the possibility of creation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, creation. Is that it? Is something new being born?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not the process of becoming.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no, that is finished. Becoming is the worst, that is time, that is the real root of this conflict. We are trying to find out what happens when the ‘I’, which is time, has completely come to an end. I believe the Buddha is supposed to have said ‘Nirvana’. And the Hindus call it Moksha. I don’t know whether the Christians call it Heaven...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The Christian mystics have had some similar state...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Similar, yes. But you see, the Christian mystics, as far as I understand it, are rooted in Jesus, in the Church, in the whole belief. They have never gone beyond it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, well that seems so. As far as I know anyway.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now we have said belief, attachment to all that is out, finished. That is all part of the ‘I’. Now when there is that absolute cleansing of the mind from the accumulation of time, which is the essence of the ‘me’, what takes place? Why should we ask what takes place?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You mean it is not a good question?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am just asking myself, why should we ask that? Is there behind it a subtle form of hope? A subtle form of saying, I have reached that point, there is nothing. Then that’s a wrong question. Wouldn’t you consider that so?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it invites you to look for some hopeful outcome.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If all endeavour is to find something beyond the ‘me’, that endeavour and the thing that I may find are still within the orbit of ‘me’. So I have no hope. There is no sense of hope, there is no sense of wanting to find anything.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What is then moving you to enquire?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>My enquiry has been to end conflict.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, we have then to be careful. We are liable to produce a hope of ending conflict.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no; there is no hope. I end it. The moment I introduce the word ‘hope’ there is a feeling of the future.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is desire.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Desire - and therefore it is of time. So I - the mind - puts all that aside completely; I mean it, completely. Then what is the essence of all this? Is my mind still seeking, or groping after something intangible that it can capture and hold? If that is so, it is still part of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that is still desire.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Desire and a subtle form of vanity.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why vanity?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Vanity in the sense ‘I have reached’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Self-deception.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Deception and all forms of illusion arise from that. So it is not that. I am clearing the decks as we go along.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Essentially it seems that you are clearing the movement of desire in its subtle forms.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In its subtle forms. So desire too has been put away. Then there is only mind - right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but then we have to ask what is meant by nature, if all is mind, because nature seems somewhat independent.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But we have also said that all the universe is the mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You mean to say nature is the mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Part of the mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The universal mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not a particular mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The particular mind then is separate, but we are talking of Mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, we have to make it clear, because you are saying that nature is the creation of universal mind, though nevertheless nature has a certain reality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is all understood.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it is almost as if nature were the thought of the universal mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is part of it. I am trying to grope towards the particular mind coming to an end; then there is only the Mind, the universal mind - right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. We have been discussing the particular mind groping through desire, and we said if all of that stopped...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is just my point. If all that has completely come to an end, what is the next step? Is there any next? We said yesterday, there is a beginning, but that word implies part of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We won’t say so much beginning, perhaps ending.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The ending, we have said that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But now is there something new?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is there something which the mind cannot capture?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which mind, the particular or the universal?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The particular has ended.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. You are saying the universal mind cannot capture it either?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what we are finding out.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying there is a reality - or something - beyond universal mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are we playing a game of peeling off one thing after another? Like an onion skin, and at the end there is only tears and nothing else?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I don’t know.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because we said there is the ending, then the cosmic, the universal mind, and, beyond, is there something more?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, would you say this ‘more’ is energy? That energy is beyond the universal mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I would say yes, because the universal mind is part of that energy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is understandable. In a way the energy is alive, you are saying?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And also intelligent?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait a minute.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In some way... In so far as it is mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now if that energy is intelligent, why has it allowed man to move away in the wrong direction?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that that may be part of a process, something that is inevitable in the nature of thought. You see if thought is going to develop, that possibility must exist. To bring about thought in man...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that the original freedom for man? To choose?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, that is, thought has to have the capacity to make this mistake.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But if that intelligence was operating, why did it allow this mistake?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we can suggest that there is a universal order, a law.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. The universe functions in order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and it is part of the order of the universe that this particular mechanism can go wrong. If a machine breaks down, it is not disorder in the universe, it is part of universal order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. In the universal order there is disorder, where man is concerned.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not disorder at the level of the universe.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. At a much lower level.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>At the level of man it is disorder.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And why has man lived from the beginning in this disorder?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because he is still ignorant, he still hasn’t seen the point.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But he is part of the whole, yet in one tiny corner man exists, and has lived in disorder. And this enormous conscious intelligence has not...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, you could say that the possibility of creation is also the possibility of disorder. That if man had the possibility of being creative, there would also be the possibility of a mistake. It could not be fixed like a machine, always to operate in perfect order. The intelligence would not have turned him into a machine that would be incapable of disorder.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, of course not. So is there something beyond the cosmic order, mind?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that the universe, that that mind, has created nature which has an order, which is not merely going around mechanically? It has some deeper meaning?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what we are trying to find out.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You are bringing in the whole universe as well as mankind. What makes you do this? What is the source of this perception?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s begin again: there is the ending of the ‘me’ as time, and so there is no hope; all that is finished, ended. In the ending of it, there is that sense of nothingness. And nothingness is this whole universe.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the universal mind, the universal matter.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The whole universe.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What led you to say that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah. I know. To put it very simply: division has come to an end. Right? The division created by time, created by thought, created by this education, and so on - all that. Because it has ended, the other is obvious.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You mean that without the division then the other is there - to be perceived?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not to be perceived, but it is there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But then how does one come to be aware that it is there?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t think one becomes aware of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then what leads you to say it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would you say it is? Not, I perceive it, or it is perceived.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. It is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You could almost say that it is saying it. In some sense, you seem to be suggesting that it is what is saying.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I didn’t want to put it - I am glad you put it like that! Where are we now?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We are saying that the universe is alive, as it were, it is mind, and we are part of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We can only say we are part of it when there is no ‘I’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No division.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No division. I would like to push it a little further; is there something beyond all this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Beyond the energy, you mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. We said nothingness, that nothingness is everything, and so it is that which is total energy. It is undiluted, pure, uncorrupted energy. Is there something beyond that? Why do we ask it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I don’t know.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I feel we haven’t touched it - I feel there is something beyond.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Could we say this something beyond is the ground of the whole? You are saying that all this emerges from an inward ground?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, there is another - I must be awfully careful here. You know one must be awfully careful not to be romantic, not to have illusions, not to have desire, not even to search. It must happen. You follow what I mean?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We are saying the thing must come from that. Whatever you are saying must come from that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>From that. That’s it. It sounds rather presumptuous.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You are actually seeing it. It is not that you look at it and say, that is what I have seen.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no. Then it is wrong.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There isn’t a division. Of course, it is easy to fall into delusion with this sort of thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but we said delusion exists as long as there is desire and thought. That is simple. And desire and thought are part of the ‘I’, which is time. When desire and time are completely ended, then there is absolutely nothing, and therefore that is the universe, that emptiness, which is full of energy. We can put a stop there...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because we haven’t yet seen the necessity for going beyond the energy. We have to see that as necessary.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think it is necessary.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but it has to be seen. We have to bring out why it is necessary.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why is it necessary? Tentatively, there is something in us that is operating, there is something in us much more - much - I don’t know how to put it - much greater. I am going slowly, slowly. What I am trying to say is, I think there is something beyond that. When I say ‘I think’, you know what I mean.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I understand, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is something beyond that. How can we talk about it? You see, energy exists only when there is emptiness. They go together.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This pure energy you talk about is emptiness. Are you suggesting there is that which is beyond the emptiness, the ground of the emptiness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Would that be something in the way of a substance? You see the question is, if it is not emptiness, then what is it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t quite follow your question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, you say something beyond emptiness, other than emptiness. I think we can follow to the energy and the emptiness. Now if we suggest something other to that, to the emptiness...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>This something other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, then that other must be different from the emptiness. Something other to emptiness, which therefore is not emptiness. Does that make sense?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then it is substance.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is what is implied: if it is not emptiness, it is substance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Substance is matter, is it not?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not necessarily, but having the quality of substance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Matter is a form of substance in the sense that it is energy, but having the form of substance as well, because it has a constant form and it resists change. It is stable, it maintains itself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But when you use the word ‘substance’, meaning beyond emptiness, does that word convey that meaning?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we are exploring the possible meaning of what you want to say. If you are saying it is not emptiness, then it would not be substance as we know it in matter. But we can see a certain quality which belongs to substance in general; if it has that quality, we could use the word substance, extend the meaning of the word substance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand. So could we use the word ‘quality’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The word ‘quality’ is not necessarily the emptiness, energy could have the quality of emptiness, you see. And therefore it is something else. Something other might have the quality of substance. That is the way I see it. And is that what you are trying to say?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is something beyond emptiness. How shall we tackle it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Firstly, what leads you to say this?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Simply the fact that there is. We have been fairly logical all along, we have not been caught in any illusions so far. And can we keep that same kind of watchfulness, in which there is no illusion, to find out - or, not find out - that which is beyond emptiness? To come down to earth. Come down to earth in the sense to be communicated. You follow what I mean?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Well we could come back to the question before: why hasn’t it come down?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why hasn’t it come down? Has man been ever free from the ‘I’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No. Not generally speaking.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. And it demands that the ‘I’ ends.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think we could look at it this way: that the ego becomes an illusion of that substance. You feel the ego is a substance too in some way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, the ego is substance.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And therefore that substance seems to be...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...untouchable.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But that ego is an illusion of the true substance - it may be that the mind tries to create some sort of illusion of that substance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is an illusion. Why do you relate it to the other?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In the sense that if the mind thinks it already has this substance, then it will not be open...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course not. Can that thing ever be put into words? It is not a question of avoiding something, or trying to slither out of some conclusion. But you see, so far we have put everything into words.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I think that once something is properly perceived, then after a while the words come to communicate it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but can that be perceived? And therefore be communicable? Is this beyond...?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This thing beyond, would you say also it is alive? Life beyond emptiness, is that still life? Living?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Living, yes. Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And intelligent?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t want to use those words.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They are too limited?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Living, intelligence, love, compassion; they are all too limited. You and I are sitting here. We have come to a point and there is that thing which perhaps later on might be put into words without any sense of pressure, and so without any illusion. Don’t you see beyond the wall? - the word, I mean? We have come to a certain point, and we are saying there is something still more - you understand? There is something behind all that. Is it palpable? Can we touch it? Is it something that the mind can capture? You follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Are you saying it is not?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t think it is possible for the mind to capture it...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Or grasp it...?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Grasp it, understand... for the mind even to look at it. You are a scientist, you have examined the atom, and so on. Don’t you, when you have examined all that, feel there is something much more, beyond all that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You can always feel that there is more beyond that, but it doesn’t tell you what it is. It is clear that whatever one knows is limited.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And there must be more beyond.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How can that communicate with you, so that you, with your scientific knowledge, with your brain capacity can grasp it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying it can’t be grasped?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. How can you grasp it? I don’t say you can’t grasp it. Can you grasp it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Look, it is not clear. You were saying before that it is ungraspable by...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Grasp, in the sense, can your mind go beyond theories...? What I am trying to say is, can you move into it? Not move, in the sense of time and all that. Can you enter it? No, those are all words. What is beyond emptiness? Is it silence?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Isn’t that similar to emptiness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is what I am getting at. Move step by step. Is it silence? Or is silence part of emptiness?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I should say that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I should say that too. If it is not silence, could we - I am just asking - could we say it is something absolute? You understand?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we could consider the absolute. It would have to be something totally independent; that is what ‘absolute’ really means. It doesn’t depend on anything.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. You are getting somewhere near it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Entirely self moving, as it were, self active.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Would you say everything has a cause, and that has no cause at all?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, this notion is already an old one. This notion has been developed by Aristotle, that this absolute is the cause of itself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It has no cause, in a sense. That is the same thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see the moment you said Aristotle... it is not that. How shall we get at this? Emptiness is energy, and that emptiness exists in silence, or the other way round, it doesn’t matter - right? Oh, yes, there is something beyond all this. Probably it can never be put into words. But it must be put into words. You follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You are saying that the absolute must be put into words, but we feel it can’t be? Any attempt to put it into words makes it relative.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I don’t know how to put all this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that we have a long history of danger with the absolute. People have put it in words, and it has become very oppressive.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Leave all that. You see, being ignorant of what other people have said, Aristotle and the Buddha, and so on, has an advantage. You understand what I mean? An advantage in the sense that the mind is not coloured by other people’s ideas, not caught in other people’s statements. All that is part of our conditioning. Now, to go beyond all that! What are we trying to do?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think, to communicate regarding this absolute, this beyond.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I took away that word ‘absolute’ immediately.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then whatever it is; the beyond emptiness and silence.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Beyond all that. There is beyond all that. All that is something, part of an immensity.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, well even the emptiness and silence is an immensity, isn’t it? The energy is itself an immensity.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I understand that. But there is something much more immense than that. Emptiness and silence and energy are immense, really immeasurable. But there is something - I am using the word, ‘greater’, than that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I am just considering. I am looking at it. One can see that whatever you say about emptiness, or about any other thing, there is something beyond.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, as a scientist, why do you accept - not accept, forgive me for using that word - why do you even move along with this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because we have come this far step by step, seeing the necessity of each step.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see all that is very logical, reasonable, sane.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And also, one can see that it is so right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So if I say there is something greater than all this silence, energy - would you accept that? Accept in the sense that up to now we have been logical.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We will say that whatever you speak of there is certainly something beyond it. Silence, energy, whatever, then there is always room logically for something beyond that. But the point is this: that even if you were to say there is something beyond that, still you logically leave room for going again beyond that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well why is that? You see, whatever you say, there is always room for something beyond.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is nothing beyond.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well that point is not clear, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is nothing beyond it. I stick to that. Not dogmatically or obstinately. I feel that is the beginning and the ending of everything. The ending and the beginning are the same - right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In which sense? In the sense that you are using the beginning of everything as the ending?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Right? You would say that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. If we take the ground from which it comes, it must be the ground to which it falls.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. That is the ground upon which everything exists, space...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...energy...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...energy, emptiness, silence, all that is. All that. Not ground, you understand?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, it is just a metaphor.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is nothing beyond it. No cause. If you have a cause then you have ground.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You have another ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. That is the beginning and the ending.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is becoming more clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. Does that convey anything to you?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, well I think that it conveys something.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Something. Would you say further, there is no beginning and no ending?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. It comes from the ground, goes to the ground, but it does not begin or end.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. There is no beginning and no ending. The implications are enormous. Is that death - not death in the sense, I will die, but the complete ending of everything?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see at first you said that the emptiness is the ending of everything, so in what sense is this more, now? Emptiness is the ending of things, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, yes. Is that death, this emptiness? Death of everything the mind has cultivated. This emptiness is not the product of the mind, of the particular mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, it is the universal mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That emptiness is that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That emptiness can only exist when there is death - total death - of the particular.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t know if I am conveying this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is the emptiness. But then you are saying that, in this ground, death goes further?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So we are saying the ending of the particular, the death of the particular, is the emptiness, which is universal. Now are you going to say that the universal also dies?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is what I am trying to say.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Into the ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Does it convey anything?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Possibly, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Just hold it a minute. Let’s see it. I think it conveys something, doesn’t it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Now if the particular and the universal die, then that is death?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. After all, an astronomer says everything in the universe is dying, exploding, dying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But of course you could suppose that there was something beyond.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think we are moving. The universal and the particular. First the particular dies into the emptiness, and then comes the universal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And that dies too.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Into the ground, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So you could say the ground is neither born nor dies.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I think it becomes almost inexpressible if you say the universal is gone, because expression is the universal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see - I am just explaining: everything is dying, except that. Does this convey anything?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Well it is out of that that everything arises, and into which it dies.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So that has no beginning and no ending.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What would it mean to talk of the ending of the universal? What would it mean to have the ending of the universal?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Nothing. Why should it have a meaning if it is happening? What has that to do with man? You follow what I mean? Man who is going through a terrible time. What has that got to do with man?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s say that man feels he must have some contact with the ultimate ground in his life, otherwise there is no meaning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it hasn’t. That ground hasn’t any relationship with man. He is killing himself, he is doing everything contrary to the ground.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is why life has no meaning for man.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am an ordinary man; I say, all right, you have talked marvellously of sunsets, but what has that got to do with me? Will that or your talk help me to get over my ugliness? My quarrels with my wife or whatever it is?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think I would go back, and say we went into this logically starting from the suffering of mankind, showing it originates in a wrong turning, that leads inevitably...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but man asks, help me to get past the wrong turn. Put me on the right path. And to that one says, please don’t become anything.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right. What is the problem then?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He won’t even listen.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then it seems to me that it is necessary for the one who sees this to find out what is the barrier to listening.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously you can see what is the barrier.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What is the barrier?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>‘I’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but I meant more deeply.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>More deeply, all your thoughts, deep attachments - all that is in your way. If you can’t leave these, then you will have no relationship with that. But man doesn’t want to leave these.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I understand. What he wants is the result of the way he is thinking.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What he wants is some comfortable, easy way of living without any trouble, and he can’t have that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No. Only by dropping all this.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There must be a connection. There must be some relationship with the ground and this, some relationship with ordinary man. Otherwise, what is the meaning of living?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is what I was trying to say before. Without this relationship...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...there is no meaning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And then people invent meaning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Even going back, the ancient religions have said similar things, that God is the ground, so they say seek God, you know.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, no, this isn’t god.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, it is not god, but it is saying the same. You could say that ‘god’ is an attempt to put this notion a bit too personally perhaps.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Give them hope, give them faith, you follow? Make life a little more comfortable to live.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, are you asking at this point: how is this to be conveyed to the ordinary man? Is that your question?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>More or less. And also it is important that he should listen to this. You are a scientist. You are good enough to listen because we are friends. But who will listen among the other scientists? I feel that if one pursues this we will have a marvellously ordered world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. And what will we do in this world?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Live.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But, I mean, we said something about creativity...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And then if you have no conflict, no ‘I’, there is something else operating.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it is important to say that, because the Christian idea of perfection may seem rather boring because there is nothing to do!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We must continue this some other time, because it is something that has got to be put into orbit.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems impossible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have gone pretty far.</p>

<h1>3. Why Has Man Given Supreme Importance to Thought?</h1>

<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What shall we talk about?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>One point relating to what we discussed before; I was reading somewhere that a leading physicist said that the more we understand the universe, the more pointless it seems, the less meaning it has. And it occurred to me that in science there may be an attempt to make the material universe the ground of our existence, so that it may have meaning physically but not...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...any other meaning. Quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And the question that we might discuss is this ground which we were talking about the other day. Is it any different to mankind, as the physical universe appears to be?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s get the question clear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not only physicists but geneticists, biologists, have tried to reduce everything to the behaviour of man - atoms, genes, you know, DNA molecules, and so on. And the more they study it, then the more they feel it has no meaning, it is just going on. Though it has meaning physically, in the sense that we can understand it scientifically, it has no deeper meaning than that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And, of course, perhaps that notion has penetrated because in the past people were more religious and felt that the ground of our existence was in something beyond matter - God, or whatever they wished to call it. And that gave them a sense of deep meaning to the whole of their existence, which has now gone away. That is one of the difficulties of modern life, the sense that it doesn’t mean anything.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So have the religious people invented something which has a meaning?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They may well have done so. You see, feeling that life has no meaning, they may have invented something beyond the ordinary. Something which is eternal...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...timeless, nameless.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...and independent, absolute.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Seeing that the way we live, genetically and all the rest of it, has no meaning, some clever erudite people said, ‘We will give it a meaning’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I think it happened before that. In the past people somehow gave meaning to life, long before science had been very much developed, in the form of religion. And science came along and began to deny this religion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. I understand that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And people no longer believe in the religious meaning. Perhaps they never were able to believe in it entirely anyway.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, how does one find out if life has a meaning beyond this? How does one find out? They have tried meditation: they have tried every form of self torture, isolation, becoming a monk, a sannyasi and so on. But they may also be deceiving themselves thoroughly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. And that is in fact why the scientists have denied it all, because the story told by the religious people is no longer plausible, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. So how does one find out if there is something more than the mere physical? How would one set about it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have been discussing the notion of some ground which is beyond matter, beyond the emptiness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But suppose you say it is so, and I say that is another illusion.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The first point is, perhaps we could clear this up: you see, if this ground is indifferent to human beings, then it would be the same as scientists’ ground in matter.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. What is the question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Is the ground indifferent to mankind? You see, the universe appears to be totally indifferent to mankind. It is immense vastness, it pays no attention, it may produce earthquakes and catastrophes, it might wipe things out, it is essentially not interested in mankind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I see what you mean, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It does not care whether man survives or does not survive - if you want to put it that way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Right. I understand the question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now I think that people felt that God was a ground who was not indifferent to mankind. You see, they may have invented it, but that is what they believed. And that is what gave them possibly...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...tremendous energy. Quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now I think the point is, would this ground be indifferent to mankind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How would you find out? What is the relationship of this ground to man, and man’s relationship to it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is the question. Does man have some significance to it? And does it have significance to man? May I add one more point? I was discussing with somebody who was familiar with the Middle East and traditions of mysticism; he told me that in these traditions they not only say that what we call this ground, this infinite, has some significance, but that what man does has ultimately some significance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite, quite. Suppose one says it has - otherwise life has no meaning, nothing has any meaning - how would one find out? Suppose you say this ground exists, as I said the other day. Then the next question is: what relationship has that to man? And man to it? How would one discover, or find out, or touch it - if the ground exists at all? If it doesn’t exist, then really man has no meaning at all. I mean, I die and you die and we all die, and what is the point of being virtuous, what is the point of being happy or unhappy, of just carrying on? How would you show that the ground exists? In scientific terms, as well as the feeling of it, the non-verbal communication of it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>When you say scientific do you mean rational?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, rational, logical, sane.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So, something that we can actually touch.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not touch, - better than touch - sense. Many can come to it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it is public.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It isn’t just one man’s assertion. But it would be scientific. I think it can be shown, but with all things one must do it, not just talk about it. Can I - or you - say the ground exists? The ground has certain demands: which are, there must be absolute silence, absolute emptiness, which means no sense of egotism in any form - right? Would you tell me that? Am I willing to let go all my egotism, because I want to prove it, I want to show it, I want to find out if what you are saying is actually true? So am I willing to say, ‘Look, complete eradication of the self’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think I can say that perhaps in some sense one is willing, but there may be another sense in which the willingness is not subject to one’s conscious effort or determination.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, wait. So we go through all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to see that...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is not will, it is not desire, it is not effort.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but when you say willingness, it contains the word ‘will’, for example.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Willingness, in the sense, go through that door. Or, am I, are we, willing to go through that particular door to find that the ground exists? You ask me that. I say, agreed, I will. I will not in the sense of exercising will and all that. What are the facets or the qualities or the nature of the self? We go into that. You point it out to me and I say, ‘Right’ - can we do it? Not be attached, not have fear - you follow? - the whole business of it. No belief, absolute rationality - you know - observation. I think if ten people do it, any scientist will accept it. But there are no ten people.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I see. We have to have the thing done together publicly...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...that’s it...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...so that it becomes a real fact.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A real fact, in the sense that people accept it. Not something based on illusion, belief, and all the rest of that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>A fact; that which is actually done.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now, who will do this? The scientists want to say that the thing is all illusory, nonsense. But there are others who say, ‘It is not nonsense, there is a ground. And if you do these things it will be there.’</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but I think that some of the things you say may not in the beginning entirely make sense to the person you talk with.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, quite, because he isn’t even willing to listen.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But also his whole background is against it. You see, the background gives you the notion of what makes sense and what doesn’t. Now, when you say, for example, one of the steps is not to bring in time...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, that’s much more difficult.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but it is fairly crucial.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But wait. I wouldn’t begin with time, I would begin at the schoolboy level.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you are going eventually to reach those more difficult points.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But begin at the schoolboy level and say ‘DO these things.’</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well what are they? Let’s go over them.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No belief.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>A person may not be able to control what he believes, he may not know what he believes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, don’t control anything. Observe that you have belief, you cling to the belief, belief gives you a sense of security and so on. And that belief is an illusion, it has no reality.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, I think if we were to talk to scientists like that they might say they were not sure about it, because they believe in the existence of the material world.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You don’t believe the sun rises and sets. It is a fact.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but the scientist believes. You see, there have been long arguments about this, there is no way to prove that it exists outside my mind, but I believe it anyway. This is one of the questions which arises. Scientists actually have beliefs. One will believe that this theory is right, and the other believes in a different one.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. I have no theories. I don’t have any theories. I start at the schoolboy level by saying, ‘Look, don’t accept theories, conclusions, don’t cling to your prejudices.’ That is the starting point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps we had better say, don’t hold to your theories, because somebody might question you if you say you have no theories. They would immediately doubt that, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I have no theories. Why should I have theories?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>If I am a scientist, I would also say I don’t have theories. I don’t see that the world which I construct for my scientific theories is also theoretical. I would call it fact.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So we have to discuss what are facts? Right? I would say that facts are what is happening, actually happening. Would you agree to that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would the scientists agree to that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Well, I think that the scientists would say that what is happening is understood through the theories. You see, in science you do not understand what is happening, except with the aid of instruments and theories.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now, wait, wait. What is happening out there, what is happening here?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s go slowly. First, what is happening out there. The instruments and theories are needed even to...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...have the facts about what is out there...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What are the facts out there?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You cannot find out without some kind of theory.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The facts there are conflict, why should I have a theory about it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I wasn’t discussing that. I was discussing the facts about matter, you see, which the scientist is concerned with. He cannot establish those facts without a certain theory, because the theory organizes the facts for him.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I understand that. That may be a fact. You may have theories about that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. About gravitation, atoms - all those things depend on theories in order to produce the right facts.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The right facts. So you start with a theory.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>A mixture of theory and fact. It is always a combination of theory and fact.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. A combination of theory and fact.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now, if you say we are going to have an area where there isn’t any such combination...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. Which is, psychologically I have no theory about myself, about the universe, about my relationship with another. I have no theory. Why should I have? The only fact is, mankind suffers, is miserable, confused, in conflict. That is a fact. Why should I have a theory about it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You must go slowly. You see, if you are intending to bring in the scientists, this has to be scientific...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...I will go very slowly...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...so that we don’t leave the scientists behind!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. Leave me behind!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, let’s accept ‘part company’ - right? The scientists might say yes, psychology is the science with which we look inwardly, to investigate the mind. And they say various people - like Freud, and Jung and others - have had theories. Now we will have to make it clear why it has no point to make these theories.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because theory prevents the observation of what is actually taking place.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but outside it seemed that the theory was helping that observation. Why the difference here?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The difference? You can discover that, it is simple.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s spell it out. Because if you want to bring in scientists you must answer this question.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We will answer it. What is the question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why is it that theories are both necessary and useful in organizing facts about matter, outwardly, and yet inwardly, psychologically, they are in the way, they are no use at all.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. What is theory? The meaning of the word, theory?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Theory means to see, to view, a kind of insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To view? That’s it. A way of looking.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And the theory helps you to look at the outside matter.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Theory means to observe.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is a way of observing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can you observe psychologically what is going on?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s say that when we look at matter outwardly, to a certain extent we fix the observing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is, the observer is different from the observed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not only different, but their relationship is fixed, relatively at least, for some time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So we can move now, a little.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This appears to be necessary in order to study matter. Matter does not change so fast, and it can be separated to some extent. We can then make a fairly constant way of looking. It changes but not immediately, it can be held constant for a while.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And we call that theory.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As you said, theory means a way of observing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is the same as ‘theatre’ in Greek.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Theatre, yes, that’s right. It is a way of looking. Now, where do we start? A common way of looking, an ordinary way of looking, the way of looking depending on the viewpoint of each person - the housewife, the husband? What do you mean by the way of looking?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The same problem arose in the development of science. We began with what was called common sense, a common way of looking. Then scientists discovered that this was inadequate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They moved away from it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They moved away, they gave up some parts of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am coming to. The common way of looking is full of prejudice.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it is arbitrary, and dependent on your background.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, all that. So can one be free of one’s background, one’s prejudice? I think one can.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The question is whether a theory of psychology would be any help in doing this. The danger is that the theory itself might be a prejudice. If you tried to make a theory...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am saying. That would become a prejudice.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That would become a prejudice because we have nothing - we have not yet observed anything to found it on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So the common factor is that man suffers - right? That is the common factor. And the way of observing matters.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. I wonder whether scientists would accept that as the most fundamental factor of man.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. Conflict?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, they have argued about it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Take anything, it doesn’t matter. Attachment, pleasure, fear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think some people might object, saying we should take something more positive.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which is what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Simply, for example, some people might have said that rationality is a common factor.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no, no! I won’t call rationality a common factor. If people were rational they wouldn’t be fighting each other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to make this clear. Let’s say in the past somebody like Aristotle might have said rationality is the common factor of man. Now your argument against it is that men are not generally rational.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, they are not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Though they might be, they are not. So you are saying that is not a fact.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think commonly scientists would say that there are many different human beings and that the common factor of mankind is that they are all striving for happiness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that the common factor? No. I won’t accept that - that many human beings are trying for happiness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>No. Human beings are all different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Agreed. Stay there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>What I am saying is that this is the common theory, which people believe to be a fact.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is, each person thinks he is totally different from others.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Yes. And they are all independently struggling for happiness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They are all seeking some kind of gratification. Would you agree to that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is one common factor. But the reason I brought up rationality was that the very existence of science is based on the notion that rationality is common to man.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But each person is seeking his own individuality.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But, you see, science would be impossible if that were entirely true.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because everybody would not be interested in the truth. The very possibility of scientific discovery depends on people feeling that this common goal of finding the truth is beyond personal satisfaction, because even if your theory is wrong you must accept that it is wrong, though it is not gratifying. That is, it becomes very disappointing for people, but they accept it, and say, well, that is wrong.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not seeking gratification. I am a common man. You have brought up that scientists take for granted that human beings are rational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>At least when they do science. They may agree that they are not very rational in private life, but they say that at least they are capable of being rational when they do scientific work. Otherwise it would be impossible to begin.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So outwardly, in dealing with matter, they are all rational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>At least they try to be, and they are to some extent.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They try to be, but they become irrational in their relationships with other human beings.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. They cannot maintain it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So that is the common factor.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. It is important to bring out this point - that rationality is limited, and, as you say, the fundamental fact is that more generally they cannot be rational. They may succeed in some limited area.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. That is a fact.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is a fact, though we don’t say it is inevitable, or that it can’t be changed.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. It is a fact.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is a fact that it has been, it has happened, it is happening.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I, as a common human being, have been irrational. And my life has been totally contradictory, and so on, which is irrational. Now can I as a human being change that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s see how we could proceed from the scientific approach. This would raise the question, why is everybody irrational?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because we have been conditioned that way. Our education, our religion, our everything.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But that won’t get us anywhere, because it leads to more questions: how did we get conditioned and so on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We can go into all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I meant that following that line is not going to answer.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. Why are we conditioned that way?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>For example, we were saying the other day that perhaps man took a wrong turning, established the wrong conditioning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The wrong conditioning from the beginning. Or, seeking security - security for myself, for my family, for my group, for my tribe - has brought about this division.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Even then you have to ask why man sought this security in the wrong way. You see, if there had been any intelligence, it would have been clear that this whole thing has no meaning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, you are going back to taking the wrong turn. How will you show me we have taken a wrong turning?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that we want to demonstrate this scientifically?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I think the wrong turn was taken when thought became all important.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What made it all important?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now let’s work it out. What made human beings enthrone thought as the only means of operation?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Also it would have to be made clear why, if thought is so important, it causes all the difficulties. These are the two questions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is fairly simple. So thought has been made king, supreme. And that may be the wrong turn of human beings.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, I think that thought became the equivalent of truth. People took thought to give truth, to give what is always true. There is the notion that we have knowledge - which may hold in certain cases for some time - but men generalize, because knowledge is always generalizing. When they got to the notion that it would always be so, this crystallized the thought of what is true. This gave thought supreme importance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You are asking, aren’t you, why has man given thought such importance?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think he has slipped into it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because he did not see what he was doing. You see, in the beginning he did not see the danger...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Just before, you said that the common ground for man is reason...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Scientists say that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>If you can show a person that something is true...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Show it to me. It is true I am irrational. That is a fact, that is truth.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But for that you don’t need reason. Observation is sufficient for that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. One goes and fights. One talks about peace. One is irrational. Dr. Bohm is pointing out that scientists say man is rational but the fact is that everyday life is irrational. Now we are asking, show us scientifically why it is irrational. That is, show man in what way he has slipped into this irrationality; why human beings have accepted this. We can say it is habit, tradition, religion. And the scientists also, they are very rational in their own field, but irrational in their lives.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>And you suggested that making thought the king is the main irrationality?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is right. We have reached that point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But how did we slip into making thought so important?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why has man given importance to thought as the supreme thing? I think that is fairly easy. Because that is the only thing he knows.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It doesn’t follow that he would give it supreme importance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because the things I know - the things thought has created, the images, all the rest of it - are more important than the things I don’t know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you see, if intelligence were operating he would not come to that conclusion. It is not rational to say that all that I know is all that is important.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, man is irrational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>He slipped into irrationality to say, all that I know is all that is important. But why should man have done this?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would you say that the mistake is made because he clings to the known, and objects to anything unknown?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is a fact, but it is not clear why he should.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because that is the only thing he has.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I am asking why he was not intelligent enough to see this.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because he is irrational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we are going around in circles!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t think so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Look, every one of these reasons you give is merely another example of man’s irrationality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is all I am saying. We are basically irrational, because we have given thought supreme importance.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But the step before that is that the thought has built up the idea that I exist?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, that comes a little later; we have to go step by step.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Surely for the ‘me’, the only thing that exists is thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would the scientists accept that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The scientist feels he is investigating the real nature of matter, independent of thought, ultimately independent anyway. He wants to know the way the universe is. He may be fooling himself, but he feels that it wouldn’t be worth doing unless he believes he is finding an objective fact.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So would you say that through the investigation of matter he is trying to find something, he is trying to find the ground?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s exactly it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But wait! Is that it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Precisely, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now the religious man says you cannot find it by becoming terribly rational in your life. He doesn’t accept that he is rational but says he is irrational in contradiction, and so on. So either he will have to clear up that first - step by step, or he can do the whole thing at one blow. Right? One accepts that one is irrational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But there is a difficulty. If you accept you are irrational, you stop, because you say, how can you begin?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But if I accept I am irrational - wait a minute - completely, then I am rational!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You will have to make that more clear. You could say that man has been deluding himself into believing that he is already rational.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t accept that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now if you don’t accept this delusion, then you are saying that rationality will be there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I don’t accept it. The fact is, I am irrational and, to find the ground, I must become extremely rational in my life. That’s all. Irrationality has been brought about by thought creating this idea of me as separate from everybody else. So can I, being irrational, find the cause of irrationality and wipe it out? If I can’t do that, I cannot reach the ground which is the most rational. Would a scientist who is investigating matter accept that the ground exists at all?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, tacitly he is assuming that it does.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It does. Mr. ‘X’ comes along and says it does exist. And you, the scientists, say, ‘Show it.’ Mr. ‘X’ says, I will show it to you. A scientist meets with other scientists, experimenting and being rational in that area, although irrational in his own life. First become rational in your life, begin here, rather than there. What would you say to all that? This must be done without effort, without desire, without will, without any sense of persuasion; otherwise you are back in the game.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s try to put it like this: even in science you could not pursue the science fully unless you were rational.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Somewhat rational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Somewhat rational, but, eventually, the failure of rationality blocks science anyway. Scientists cling to their theories, and they become jealous and so on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it, that is all. The irrationality overcomes them.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So then you could say you might as well look at the source of the whole irrationality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But now you have to make it clear that it really can be done.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh yes, I am showing it to you. I say, first recognize, see, observe, be aware that you are totally irrational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The word ‘totally’ will cause trouble, because if you were totally irrational you couldn’t even begin to talk.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, that is my question. I say one is totally irrational. First, recognize it. Watch it. The moment you admit there is some part of me that is rational, who wants to wipe away the irrationality...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...It is not that, but there must be sufficient rationality to understand what you are talking about.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Essentially, I would rather put it that one is dominated by one’s irrationality, even though there is enough rationality to discuss the question.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I question that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, otherwise we couldn’t begin to talk.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But listen. We begin to talk. A few of us begin to talk because we are willing to listen to each other, we are willing to say, we’ll set aside any conclusions we have; we are willing to listen to each other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is part of rationality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>With some of us perhaps, but the vast majority is not willing to listen to us, because we are concerned, serious enough to find out if the ground exists. That gives us rationality to listen to each other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Listening is necessary for rationality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Are we saying the same thing?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The scientist, through the examination of matter, hopes to reach the ground. We and ‘X’ and ‘Y’ say, let us become rational in our life. Which means that you and I, and ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are willing to listen to each other. That’s all. The very listening is the beginning of rationality. Some people won’t listen to us or to anybody. So can we, who are listening, be somewhat rational, and begin? That is all my point. This is being terribly logical, isn’t it? So can we proceed from there?</p>
<p>Why has man brought about this irrationality in his life? A few of us can apparently throw off some part of irrationality, become somewhat rational and say, now, let’s start. Let us start to find out why man lives this way. Now what is the common dominant factor in all our lives? Obviously it is thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is so. Of course many people might deny that and say it is feeling, or that something else is the major factor.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Many people might say that, but thought is part of feeling.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but that is not commonly understood.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We will explain it. Feeling - if there was no thought behind it, would you be able to recognize it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I think this is a major difficulty, in communication with some people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So we begin. There may be some who don’t see this, but I want the free ‘X’ and ‘Y’ to see it, because they have become somewhat rational, therefore they are listening to each other. They can say thought is the main source of this current.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then we have to say, what is thought?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think that is fairly simple. Thought brings about irrationality.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but what is it? How do you know you are thinking? What do you mean by thinking?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Thinking is the movement of memory, which is experience, knowledge, stored in the brain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Suppose we want to have rationality which includes rational thought. Is rational thought only memory?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait a minute. Let’s be careful. If we are completely rational, there is total insight. That insight uses thought, and then it is rational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then thought is not only memory?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I mean since it is being used by insight...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, insight uses thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but what thought does is not just due to memory now.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait a minute.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Outwardly thought runs on its own, it runs like a machine on its own, and it is not rational.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But when thought is the instrument of insight...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then thought is not memory.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not based on memory.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, not based on memory.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Memory is used, but it is not based on memory.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then what? Thought being limited, divisive, incomplete, can never be rational...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Without insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. Now, how are we to have insight which is total rationality? Not the rationality of thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I should call it rationality of perception.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, rationality of perception.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then thought becomes the instrument of that, so it has the same order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now how am I to have that insight? That is the next question. Isn’t it? What am I to do, or not to do, to have this instant insight, which is not of time, which is not of memory, which has no cause, which is not based on reward or punishment? It is free of all that. Now how does the mind have this insight? When I say, I have the insight, that is wrong. Obviously. So how is it possible for a mind which has been irrational, and has become somewhat rational, to have that insight? It is possible to have that insight if your mind is free from time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right. Let’s go slowly because you see, if we go back to the scientific, even common sense point of view, implicitly time is taken as the ground of everything in scientific work. In fact even in ancient Greek mythology Chronos, the god of time, produces his children and swallows them. That is exactly what we said about the ground; everything comes from the ground and dies to the ground. So, in a way, mankind long ago began to take time already as the ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And then someone comes along and says time is not the ground.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s right. So until now even scientists have been looking for the ground in time - and everybody else too!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is the whole point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now you say time is not the ground. Somebody might say this is nonsense, but we say, we will stay open to that, although some people might easily dismiss it right away. Now if you say time is not the ground, we don’t know where we are.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know where I am. We will go into it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Is time the same movement as this thought which we described first?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, time is that. Time is thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s go slowly again on that, because there is, as we have often said, chronological time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, that is simple.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but in addition we are thinking. You see, thinking takes time chronologically, but in addition it projects a kind of imaginary time...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...which is the future.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which is the future and the past as we experience it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That time which is imagined is also a kind of real process of thinking.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is a fact.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is a fact that it takes time, physically, to think, but we also have time when we can imagine the whole past and future.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, which are facts.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So let’s say that this time is not the ground, perhaps not even physically.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are going to find out.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but we feel it to be the ground, because we feel that we, as the self, exist in time. Without time there could be no ‘me’.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>‘I’ must exist in time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Eternally being something, or becoming something.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Becoming and being are in the field of time. Now can the mind, which has evolved through time...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>What do you mean by mind then?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Mind - the brain, my senses, my feeling, all that is the mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The particular mind, you mean.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Particular mind, of course, I am talking of the mind that has evolved through time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Even its particularity depends on time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Time, of course, and all the rest of it. Now we are asking, can that mind be free of time, to have an insight which is totally rational, which then can operate on thought? That thought is totally rational, not based on memory. Agreed?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now how am I - as ‘X’ and ‘Y’ - to be free of time? I know I need time to go from here to there, to learn a lesson, a technique, etc. I understand that very clearly, so I am not talking about that time. I am talking about time as becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>As being.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, becoming is being. I start from being to become.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And being something in myself. Being better, being happier.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, the whole thing - the more. Now can I, can my brain investigating to find out if the ground exists, can my whole mind be free of time? We have now separated time. The time which is necessary, and the time which is not necessary. That is, can my brain not function as it has always done, in time as thought? Which means, can thought come to an end? Would you accept that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but could you make that more clear? We can see that the first question is, can my brain not be dominated by the function of thought?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, which is time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And then, if you say thought comes to an end...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No! Can time as thought come to a stop?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Psychological time comes to a stop.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I am talking of that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But we will still have the rational thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. That is understood. We have said that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We are discussing the thought of conscious experience.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Of becoming and being...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And the retention of memory; you know, the past, as knowledge. Oh, yes, that can be done.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You really mean the memory of experiences?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The memory of experiences, hurts, attachments, the whole of it. Now can that come to an end? Of course it can. This is the point: it can come to an end when the very perception asks, what is it? What is hurt? What is psychological damage? The perception of it is the ending of it. Not carrying it over, which is time. The very ending of it is the ending of time. I think that is clear. ‘X’ is hurt, wounded from childhood. And he, by listening, talking, discussing, realizes that the continuation of the hurt is time. And to find out the ground, time must end. So he says, can my hurt end instantly, immediately?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I think there are some steps in that. You say, he finds that hurt is time, but the immediate experience of it is that it exists on its own.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know, of course. We can go into that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That simply is something on its own.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means, I have created an image about myself and the image is hurt, but not me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. In the becoming, which is time, I have created an image about myself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, thought has created that image.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Thought has created an image through experience, through education, through conditioning, and made this image separate from me. But this image is actually ‘me’, although we have separated the image and the me, which is irrational. So, in realizing that the image is ‘me’, I have become somewhat rational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that will not be clear - because if I am hurt I feel the image is ‘me’.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The image is you.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The person who is hurt feels that way, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. But the moment you operate on it you separate yourself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s the point. Now the first feeling is that the image is ‘me’ hurt, and the second feeling is that I draw back from the image in order to operate on it...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...which is irrationality.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...because it is not correct.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And that brings in time, because I say it will take time to do that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite right. So by seeing that, I become rational, and act. The act is to be free of it immediately.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s go into that. The first thing is that there has been a hurt. That is the image, but at first I don’t separate it. I feel identified with it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I am that. But then I draw back, and say that I think there must be a ‘me’ who can do something.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, can operate on it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now that takes time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is time, but I mean, I am thinking it takes time. Now I have to go slowly. If I don’t do that, that hurt cannot exist.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it is not obvious in the experience itself that this is so.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First let’s go slowly into it. I am hurt. That is a fact. Then I separate myself - there is a separation - saying, I will do something about it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The ‘me’ who will do something is different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Different, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And he thinks about what he should do.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The ‘me’ is different because it is becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It projects into the future a different state.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I am hurt. There is a separation, a division. The ‘me’, which is always pursuing the becoming, says, I must control it. I must wipe it out. I must act upon it, or I will be vengeful, hurtful. So this movement of separation is time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We can see that now. The point is, there is something here that is not obvious. A person is thinking that the hurt exists independently of ‘me’, and I must do something about it. I project into the future the better state and what I will do. Let’s try to make this very clear, because you are saying that there is no separation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>My rationality discovers there is no separation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is no separation, but the illusion that there is a separation helps to maintain the hurt.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. Because the illusion is, I am becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. I am this and will become that. So I am hurt and I will become non-hurt. Now that very thought maintains the hurt.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Is the separation not already there when I become conscious and say I am hurt?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am hurt. Then I say, I am going to hit you because you have hurt me, or I say, I must suppress it - or I create fear, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But isn’t that feeling of separation there from the moment I say I am hurt?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is irrationality.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>That is irrational already?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, when you say, does not the separation exist already when I say ‘I am hurt’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It does, but I think that before that happens you get a kind of shock. The first thing that happens is a mild shock, a pain or whatever, which you identify with that shock. Then you explain it by saying ‘I am hurt’, and that immediately implies the separation to do something about it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. If I am not hurt I don’t know anything about separation or not separation. If I am hurt, I am irrational as long as I maintain that hurt and do something about it, which is to become. Then irrationality comes in. I think that is right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now if you don’t maintain it, what happens? Suppose you say, I won’t go on with this becoming?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, that is quite a different matter. It means I am no longer thinking, no longer observing, or using time as an observation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You could say that is not your way of looking. It is not your theory any more.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because you could say time is a theory which everybody adopts for psychological purposes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That is the common factor; time is the common factor of man. And we are pointing out time is an illusion...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Psychological time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, that is understood.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that when we no longer approach this through time, then the hurt does not continue?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It does not continue, it ends - because you are not becoming anything.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In becoming you are always continuing what you are.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. Continuing what you are, modified...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is why you struggle to become.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are talking about insight. That is, insight has no time. Insight is not the product of time, time being memory, etc. So there is insight. That insight being free of time acts upon memory, acts upon thought. That is, insight makes thought rational, but not thought which is based on memory. Then what the devil is that thought?</p>
<p>No. Wait a minute. I don’t think thought comes in at all. We said insight comes into being when there is no time. Thought - which is based on memory, experience, knowledge - that is the movement of time as becoming. We are talking of psychological and not chronological time. We are saying to be free of time implies insight. Insight, being free of time, has no thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We said that it may use thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait. I am not sure. Just go slowly. It may use thought to explain, but it acts. Before, action was based on thought. Now, when there is insight, there is only action. Why do you want thought? Because insight is rational, action is rational. Action becomes irrational when it is acting from thought. So insight doesn’t use thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we have to make it clear because in a certain area it has to use thought... If, for example, you want to construct something you would use the thought which is available on how to do it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But that is not insight.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But even so you may have to have insight in that area.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Partial. The scientists, the painters, the architects, the doctors, the artists and so on have partial insight. But we are talking of ‘X’ and ‘Y’, who are seeking the ground; they are becoming rational, and we are saying insight is without time, and therefore without thoughts, and that insight is action. Because that insight is rational, action is rational. Forgive me, I am not making myself an example, I am talking in all humility. That boy, that young man in 1929 dissolved the Order of the Star. There was no thought. People said, ‘Do this’, ‘Don’t do that’, ‘Keep it’, ‘Don’t keep it’. He had an insight; dissolved it. Finished! Why do we need thought?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But then you used some thought in dissolving the Order to say, when to do it, how to do it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That word is used merely for convenience, for communication with other people.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But still some thought was needed.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The decision acts.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I didn’t mean about the decision. The primary action did not require thought; only that which followed.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is nothing. It is like moving a cushion from there to there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I understand that. Then the primary source of action does not involve thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is all I wanted to say.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it sort of filters through into...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...it is like a wave.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Does not all thought undergo a transformation in this process?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, of course. Because insight is without time, therefore the brain itself has undergone a change.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, now could we talk about what you mean by that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Does it mean that every human response must be viewed by, or must enter into insight? I will tell you what I mean. I am jealous. Is there an insight which will cover the whole field of jealousy and so end it? End envy, greed, and all that is involved in jealousy. You follow? Irrational people go step by step - get rid of jealousy, get rid of attachment, get rid of anger, get rid of this, that and the other. Which is a constant process of becoming - right? But insight, which is totally rational, wipes all that away.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that a fact? Fact, in the sense that ‘X’ and ‘Y’ will never be jealous again; never!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to discuss that, because it is not clear how you could guarantee it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes, I will guarantee it!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If it can reach those who are able to listen...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means that to find the ground the first thing is to listen.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, scientists cannot always listen. Even Einstein and Bohr were not able at a certain point to listen to each other. Each one was attached to his particular view.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They brought their irrationality into operation.</p>

<h1>4. Breaking the Pattern of Ego-centred Activity</h1>

<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I would like to ask a question which may lead us to something: what will make man change, deeply, fundamentally, radically? He has had crisis after crisis, he has had a great many shocks, he has been through every kind of misfortune, every kind of war, personal sorrow, and so on. A little affection, a little joy, but all this doesn’t seem to change him. What will make a human being leave the way he is going, and move in a totally different direction? I think that is one of our great problems, don’t you? Why? If one is concerned, as one must be, with humanity, with all the things that are going on, what would be the right action to move man out of one direction to another? Is this question valid? Has it any significance?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>Well, unless we can see this action, it won’t have much significance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Has the question any significance?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What it means is, indirectly, to ask what is holding people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, same thing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If we could find out what is holding people in their present direction...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it the basic conditioning of man, this tremendous egotistic attitude and action, which won’t yield to anything? It appears to change, it appears to yield, but the centre remains the same. Perhaps this may not be in the line of our dialogue over the last two or three days, but I thought we might start with this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Have you some notion of what is holding people? Something that would really change them?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What is it then?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is it that is blocking? Do we approach through environmental conditioning, from the outer to the inner, and discover from man’s outer activities, the inner? And then discover that the outer is the inner, the same movement, and then go beyond it to see what it is? Could we do that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>When you say outward, what do you mean? Do you mean the social conditions?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The social conditioning, the religious conditioning, education, poverty, riches, climate, food; the outer. Which may condition the mind in a certain direction. But as one examines it a little more, the psychological conditioning is also from the outer, somewhat.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is true that the way a person thinks is going to be affected by his whole set of relationships. But that doesn’t explain why the conditioning is so rigid, and why it holds.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am asking too.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. If it were merely outward conditioning, one would expect it to be more easily changed. For example, you could have some other outward condition.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They have tried all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the whole belief of Communism was that with a new society there would be a new man. But there have been none! I think that there is something fundamentally in the inward that holds, that resists change.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is it? Will this question lead us anywhere?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Unless we actually uncover it, it will lead nowhere.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think one could find out, if one applied one’s mind. I am just asking: is this question worthwhile, and is it related to what we have been discussing? Or shall we take up something else in relation to what we have been talking about?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I think that we have been talking of bringing about an ending to time, an ending to becoming. And we talked of coming into contact with the ground, through complete rationality. But now we could say that the mind is not rational.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, we said man is basically irrational.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This is perhaps part of the block. If we were completely rational, then we would of necessity come to this ground. Would that be right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. We were talking the other day about the ending of time. The scientists, through the investigation of matter, want to find out that point. Also the so-called religious people have endeavoured to find out - not only verbally - if time can stop. We went into that quite a bit, and we say it is possible for a human being, who will listen, to find out through insight the ending of time. Because insight is not memory. Memory is time, memory is experience, knowledge stored up in the brain, and so on. As long as that is in operation there is no possibility of having insight into anything. Total insight, not partial insight. The artist, the scientist, the musician, they all have partial insights and therefore they are still time-bound.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have a total insight, which is the ending of the ‘me’, because the ‘me’ is time? Me, my ego, my resistance, my hurts, all that. Can that ‘me’ end? It is only when that ends that there is total insight. That is what we discovered.</p>
<p>And we went into the question, is it possible for a human being to end totally this whole structure of the ‘me’? We said yes, and went into it. Very few people will listen to this because it is perhaps too frightening. And the question then arises: if the ‘me’ ends, what is there? Just emptiness? There is no interest in that. But if one is investigating without any sense of reward or punishment, then there is something. We say that something is total emptiness, which is energy and silence. Well that sounds nice, but it has no meaning to an ordinary man who is serious and wants to go beyond it, beyond himself. And we pushed it further: is there something beyond all this? And we say there is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The ground. Is it that the beginning of this enquiry is to listen? Will I, as a human being, give up my egocentric activity completely? What will make me move away from that? What will make a human being move away from this destructive, self-centred activity? If he will move away through reward, or punishment, then that is just another thought, motive. So discard that. Then what will make human beings renounce - if I may use the word - renounce it completely without motive?</p>
<p>You see, man has tried everything in this direction - fasting, self-torture in various forms, abnegating himself through belief and denying himself through identification with something greater. All the religious people have tried it, but the ‘me’ is still there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. The whole activity has no meaning, but somehow this does not become evident. People will move away from something which has no meaning, and makes no sense, ordinarily speaking. But it seems that the perception of this fact is rejected by the mind. The mind is resisting it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The mind is resisting this constant conflict, and moving away from it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is moving away from the fact that this conflict has no meaning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>People don’t see that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Also the mind is set up purposefully to avoid seeing it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The mind is avoiding it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is avoiding it almost on purpose, but not quite consciously, like the people of India who say they are going to retire to the Himalayas because nothing can be done.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But that is hopeless. You mean to say that the mind, having lived so long in conflict, refuses to move away from it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not clear why it refuses to give it up; why the mind does not wish to see the full meaninglessness of the conflict. The mind is deceiving itself, it is covering up.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The philosophers and so-called religious people have emphasized struggle, emphasized the sense of striving, control, effort. Is that one of the causes why human beings refuse to let go of their way of life?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Possibly. They hope that by fighting or struggling they will achieve a better result. Not to give up what they have, but to improve it by struggle.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Man has lived for two million years; what has he achieved? More wars, more destruction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What I am trying to say is that there is a tendency to resist seeing this, but also to go back to hoping that the struggle will produce something better.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not quite sure if we have cleared this point; that the intellectuals - I am using the word respectfully - the intellectuals of the world have emphasized this factor of struggle.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Many of them have, I suppose.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Most of them.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Karl Marx.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Marx and even Bronowski, who talk of more and more struggle, of acquiring more and more knowledge. Is it that the intellectuals have such extraordinary influence on our minds?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think people do this without any encouragement from intellectuals. You see, struggle has been emphasized everywhere.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I mean. Everywhere. Why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, in the beginning people thought it would be necessary because they had to struggle against nature in order to survive.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So struggling against nature has been transferred to the other?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is part of it. You see you must be a brave hunter, and you must struggle against your own weakness to become brave. Otherwise you can’t do it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s it. So is it that our minds are conditioned, shaped, held, in this pattern?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well that is certainly true, but it doesn’t explain why it is so extraordinarily hard to change it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because I am used to it. I am in a prison, but I am used to it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I think that there is a tremendous resistance to moving away from it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why does a human being resist this? If you come along and point out the fallacy, the irrationality of this, and you show the whole cause and effect, give examples, data, everything else? Why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is what I said, that if people were capable of complete rationality they would drop it, but I think that there is something more to the problem. You see, you may expose the irrationality of it but there is something more, in the sense that people are not fully aware of this whole pattern of thought. Having had it exposed at a certain level, it still continues at levels that they are not aware of.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But what would make them aware?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is what we have to find. I think people have to become aware that they have this tendency to go on with the conditioning. It might be mere habit, or it might be the result of many past conclusions, all operating now, without people knowing it. There are so many different things that keep people in this pattern. You might convince somebody that the pattern makes no sense, but when it comes to the actual affairs of life he has a thousand different ways of proceeding which imply that pattern.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. Then what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I think that a person would have to be extremely interested in this to break all that down.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then what will bring a human being to this state of extreme interest? You see, they have even been offered heaven as a reward if they do this. Various religions have done this, although that becomes too childish.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is part of the pattern - reward. Ordinarily the rule is that I follow the self-enclosed pattern except when something really big comes up.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A crisis.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Or when a reward is to be obtained.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is a pattern of thinking. People must in some way believe that it has value. If everybody were able to work together and suddenly we were able to produce harmony, then everybody would say, fine, I will give up myself. But in the absence of that, I had better hold on to what I have! That is the sort of thinking.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Hold on to what is known.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I don’t have much, but I had better hold on to it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So are you saying that if everybody does this, I will do it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is the common way of thinking. Because as soon as people begin to start to cooperate in an emergency, then a great many people go along.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So they form communes. But all those have failed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because after a while this special thing goes away and they fall back to the old pattern.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The old pattern. So I am asking, what will make a human being break through this pattern?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Isn’t it related to the question we dealt with before - time and no time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But I know nothing about time, I know nothing about all this, it is just a theory to me. Yet the fact is, I am caught in this pattern and I can’t let it go. The analysts have tried it, the religious people have tried it, everybody has tried to make human beings intelligent - but they have not succeeded.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But they don’t see that the very attempt at letting go the pattern or ending the conflict is still strengthening the conflict.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, that is just a theory.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But you can explain that to them.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You can explain. As we said, there are a dozen very rational explanations. At the end of it we fall back to this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well, you only fall back to that if you have not really understood it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Have you understood it when you say that? Why haven’t I, or you, said ‘finished’! You can give me a thousand explanations, and all probably a bit irrational, but I say, have you done it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I don’t even understand the question, when you ask, have I done it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not being personal. You have given an explanation of why human beings can’t move away from this pattern, or break through it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>No, I give you more than the explanation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What do you give me?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>If I observe something to be correct, then the description of the observation is more than just explanation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but can I observe this clearly?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well, that is the problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So help me to see it clearly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>For that there must be an interest.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Please don’t say ‘must’. I haven’t got an interest. I am interested, as Dr. Bohm pointed out just now, when there is a tremendous crisis such as war. Then I forget myself. In fact, I am glad to forget myself, to give the responsibility to the generals, to the politicians. Under a crisis I forget, but the moment the crisis goes away I am back to my pattern. That is happening all the time. Now, I say to myself, what will make me relinquish this pattern, or break through it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Isn’t it that one must see the falseness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Show it to me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I can’t, because I have not seen it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then what shall I do as a human being? You have explained to me ten thousand times how ugly it is, how destructive it is, and so on, but I fall back to this pattern all the time. Help me, or show me how to break the pattern. You understand my question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well then you are interested?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. Now what will make me be interested? Pain?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Sometimes it does for a moment, but it goes away.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what will make me as a human being so alert, so aware, so intense that I will break through this thing?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You state the question in terms of an action, breaking through, relinquishing. Isn’t it a matter of seeing?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Show me, help me to see, because I am resisting you. My pattern, so deeply ingrained in me, is holding back - right? I want proof, I want to be convinced.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>We have to go back to this question - why do I want to have proof? Why do I want to be convinced?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because someone says that this is a stupid, irrational way of looking. And he shows us all the effects of it, the cause of it, and we say, yes but we can’t let go!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You may say that is the very nature of ‘me’, that I must fulfil my needs no matter how irrational they are.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>First I must take care of my own needs, and then I can try to be rational.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What are our needs then?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Some of the needs are real and some are imaginary but...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s it. The imaginary, illusory needs sway the other needs.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you see, I may need to believe I am good and right, and to know that I will be always there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Help me to break that!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think I have to see that this is an illusion. You see, if it seems real, what can I do? Because if I am really there, I need all this, and it is foolish to talk of being rational if I am going to vanish, break down or something. You have proposed to me that there is another state of being where I am not there - right? And when I am there, this doesn’t make any sense!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, quite. But I am not there. Suppose as a human being, heaven is perfect, but I am not there; please help me to get there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, it is something different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know what you are saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Can one see the illusory nature of that very demand that I want to go to heaven? Or I want to be enlightened, or I want to be this, I want to be that? But this very question, this very demand is...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>This demand is based on becoming, on the more.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>That is illusory.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. You say that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You haven’t demonstrated it to me, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is an idea to you. It is just a theory. Show me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well, are we willing really to explore the question?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are willing on one condition - that we find something at the end of it. See how the human mind works. I will climb the highest mountain if I can get something out of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Can the mind see that this is the problem?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but it can’t let go.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well if it sees...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You are going round and round in circles!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It sees the problem abstractly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is it. Now why do I see it abstractly?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>First of all, it is a lot easier.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don’t go back to that. Why does my mind make an abstraction of everything?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s begin by saying that to a certain extent it is the function of thought to make abstractions outwardly, but then we carry them inwardly. It is the same sort of thing as before.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So is there something else - I am just asking - that we are missing in this altogether? That is, if I may point out, we are still thinking in the same old pattern.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The question itself contains that pattern, doesn’t it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but the pursuit of the pattern is traditional.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I mean that in framing this question, the pattern has continued.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, so can we move away altogether from this, and look at it differently. Can the human mind say, all right, we have tried all this - Marx, Buddha, everybody has pointed out something or other. But obviously after a million years, we are still somehow caught in that pattern - saying we must be interested, we must listen, we must do this, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is still time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Then what happens if I leave all that, actually leave it? I won’t even think in terms of it. No more explanations, or new twists, that are the same old twists! So I say let’s leave that area completely and look at the problem differently, the problem being, why do I always live in this centre of ‘me’? I am a serious human being; I have listened to all this and after fifty years I know all the explanations - what I should, should not do, etc. Can I say, all right, I will discard all that? That means I stand completely alone. Does that lead anywhere?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Possibly, yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think it does lead somewhere.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems to me that basically you are saying leave all this knowledge of mankind behind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Apparently it is out of its place.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Leave all the knowledge, and experiences, explanations, causes that man has created - discard all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But you are still left with the same mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah! I have not such a mind. It is not the same mind. When I discard all this, my mind has changed. My mind is this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>No, isn’t the mind also the basic set-up?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which I have discarded.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But you can’t discard that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I mean this is an organism.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now, wait a minute. My organism has been shaped by knowledge, by experience. And more knowledge which I have acquired as I have evolved, as I have grown. As I have gathered more and more, it has strengthened me, and I have been walking on that path for millennia. And I say, perhaps I may have to look at this problem totally differently - which is not to walk on that path at all, but to discard all knowledge I have acquired.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In this area, in this psychological place.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Psychologically, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>At the core, at the source, knowledge is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Further down the line it becomes relevant.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. That is understood.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But I have one question. The mind at the beginning of its evolution was in that same position. The mind at the beginning of whatever you call man was in that position.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. I don’t accept that. Why do you say that? The moment it comes into being, it is already caught in knowledge. Would you say that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think it is implicit in the structure of thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>First of all, to have knowledge about the outward, and then to apply this to the inward, without understanding that it was going to be caught in it. Therefore it extended that knowledge into the area of psychological becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well, if the mind started new, it would go through the same mistake again.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, certainly not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Unless it has learnt.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I don’t want to learn. You are still pursuing the same old path. I don’t want to learn. Please, just let me go into this a little bit.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We should clear this up because on other occasions you have said it is important to learn, even about observing yourself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now you are saying something quite different. It should be made clear why it is different. Why is it that you have given up the notion of learning at this stage?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>At this stage, because I am still gathering memory.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But there was a state when it was important to learn about the mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don’t go back. I am just starting. I have lived for sixty, eighty, or a hundred years. And I have listened to all this - the teachers in India, the Christians, the Muslims; I have listened to all the psychological explanations, to Freud, Marx and everybody.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think we should go a bit further. We agree that is all negative stuff, but in addition perhaps I have observed myself, and learned about myself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Myself, yes, add that. And, at the end of it, I say perhaps this is a wrong way of looking at it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right. Having explored that way, we finally are able to see it might be wrong.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Perhaps.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well I would say that in some sense perhaps it was necessary to explore that way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or not necessary.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It may not have been, but given the whole set of conditions it was bound to happen.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. So now I have come to a point when I say discard - we will put in that word - all that knowledge, because that hasn’t led me anywhere, in the sense that I am not free of my egocentricism.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But that alone isn’t enough because if you say it hasn’t worked, you can always hope or suppose that it may. But in fact you could see that it can’t work.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It can’t work. I am definite on that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not enough to say it hasn’t worked, actually it cannot work.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It cannot work because it is based on time and knowledge, which is thought. And these explanations are based on thought - to acquire knowledge and so on and so on. Would you say that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>As far as we have gone we have based them on knowledge and thought. And not only thought, but the habitual patterns of skill are an extension of thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So I put those aside, not casually, not with an interest in the future - but seeing the same pattern being repeated and repeated; different colours, different phrases, different pictures, different images - I discard all that totally. Instead of going North, as I have been going for millennia, I have stopped and am going East, which means my mind has changed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Has the structure of the ‘me’ gone?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Without insight into it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. I won’t bring in insight for the moment.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But there was insight to do that. I mean to say that to consider doing it was an insight. The insight was the thing that worked.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I won’t bring in that word.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>When you said that the whole thing could not work, I think that is an insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>For me. I see it cannot work. But then we go back again to how do I acquire insight, and all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But leaving that aside and just saying that it was an insight, the question of how to acquire it is not the point.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is an insight that says ‘out’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Out to the pattern.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, finished with this constant becoming through experience, knowledge, patterns. Finished!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Would you say that the kind of thinking afterwards, is a totally different kind of thinking? Evidently one still must think.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not sure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well you may call it something else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, I won’t call it anything else. Please I am just fishing around. After having lived a hundred years, I see everybody pointing out the way to end the self, and that way is based on thought, time, knowledge. And I say, sorry, I know all that, I have used that. I have an insight into that; therefore it falls away. Therefore the mind has broken the pattern completely. Not going North but East, you break the pattern.</p>
<p>Now, all right. Suppose Dr. Bohm has this insight, and has broken away from the pattern. Please let us help another human being to come to that. Don’t say you must be interested, you must listen, then fall back - you follow? What is your communication with another human being, so that he hasn’t got to go through all this mess? What will make me absorb so completely what you have said, so that it is in my blood, in my brain, everything, so that I see this thing? What will you do? Or is there nothing to do - you follow my question? Because if you have that insight it is a passion, it is not just a clever insight, nor is it possible to sit back and be comfortable; it is a passion that won’t let you sit still, you must move, give - whatever it is. What will you do? You have that passion of this immense insight. And that passion must, like a river with a great volume of water flowing over the banks, move in the same way.</p>
<p>Now, I am a human being, ordinary, fairly intelligent, well read, experienced. I have tried this, that and the other thing, and I meet someone who is full of this, and I say, why won’t I listen to him?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I think we do listen.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Do we?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Just go very, very slowly. Do we so completely listen that there is no resistance, no saying why, what is the cause, why should I? You follow what I mean? We have been through all that. We have walked the area endlessly, back and forward from corner to corner, North, South, East, West. And ‘X’ comes along and says, look there is a different way of living, something totally new; which means listening completely.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>If there is a resistance one does not see the resistance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don’t begin all over again on why you resist. I will show you your resistance, by talking. You know. But yet you go back.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Krishnaji, did not your initial question go beyond this, when you asked, let’s leave the listening, the rationality, the thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but that is just an idea. Will you do it? ‘X’ comes along and says, ‘Look, eat this.’</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I would eat it if I could see it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes, you can see it, very clearly. We said, don’t go back to the pattern. See! Then you say, how am I to see? which is the old pattern. Just see! ‘X’ refuses to enter that pattern.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>The pattern of explanation?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Knowledge, all that. He says come over, don’t go back.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Krishnaji, to talk about a normal situation in the world; there are a number of people who ask one with similar words to see, put thought aside; if one would really look at this thing one would see it. That is what the priests tell us. So what is the difference?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I am not a priest. I have left all that. I have left the church, the gods, Jesus, the Buddhas, the Krishnas, I have left all that, Marx, Engels, all the analysts, all the pundits, everybody. You see, you haven’t done that. Ah, you say, no, I can’t do it until you show me there is something else beyond all that. And ‘X’ says, ‘Sorry.’ Has that any meaning?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. I think that we say, leave all the knowledge behind. But knowledge takes many subtle forms which we don’t see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. You are full of this insight and you have discarded all knowledge because of that. And another keeps on paddling over the pool of knowledge. And you say, leave it. The moment we enter into explanations we are back in the game. And you refuse to explain.</p>
<p>You see, explanations have been the boat in which to cross to the other shore. And the man on the other shore says there is no boat. But ‘X’ says, cross! He is asking something impossible, isn’t he?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If it doesn’t happen right away, then it is impossible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Absolutely. He is asking something impossible for one to do. I am meeting ‘X’, who is immovable. Either I have to go round him, avoid him or go over him. I can’t do any of that. But ‘X’ won’t leave me alone, in the sense that I have met something immovable. And it is there night and day with me. I can’t battle with it because there is nothing to get hold of.</p>
<p>So what happens to me when I meet something that is completely solid, immovable, absolutely true, what happens to me? Is that the problem? That we have never met something like that? We may climb the Himalayas, but Everest is always there. In the same way, perhaps human beings have never met something irrevocable. Something absolutely immovable. Either we are terribly puzzled by it, or we say, well we can’t do anything about it. Walk away from it. Or it is something that we must investigate - you follow - we must capture. Which is it?</p>
<p>Here is a solid thing. I am confronted by it. As I said, I might run away from it, which I generally do. Or worship it. Or try to understand what it is. When I do all these things, I am back in the old pattern. So I discard that. When meeting ‘X’, who is immovable, I see what the nature of it is. I am movable, as a human being, but ‘X’ is immovable. The contact with it does something, it must. It is not some mystic, occult stuff but it is simple, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Sir, it functions like a magnet, but it doesn’t break something.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, because you haven’t let go the pattern. It is not ‘X’s’ fault.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I didn’t say it was.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, the implication is that. Therefore you are back, you are dependent.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>What is taking place?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am saying, you meet ‘X’; what happens?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You said, an effort to understand.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, there you are, lost. You are back in the old pattern. You see it, you feel it, you know it, you recognize it. It doesn’t matter what word you use, it is there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, can’t you say that ‘X’ communicates the absolute necessity of not going on with the old pattern, because you see it absolutely can’t work.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes put it in your own words. All right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And therefore that is unalterable, immovable - is that what you mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I am movable; ‘X’ is immovable.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, what is behind ‘X’, what is working in ‘X’ is immovable. Wouldn’t you say that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is working is something of a shock at first, naturally. I have been moving, moving, moving, then I meet something that is immovable. Suddenly something takes place, obviously. You can see what takes place. ‘X’ is not becoming, and I am becoming. And ‘X’ has been through explanations and all the rest of it, and he shows that becoming is painful. (I am putting it quickly, in a few words.) And I meet that. So there is the sensitivity - all right, let’s put it the other way. The explanations and the discarding of all the explanations have made me sensitive. Much more alert. When I meet something like ‘X’, naturally there is a response not in terms of explanation or understanding. There is a response to that. There is bound to be. Explanations have been given over and over again. I have listened, but either they have made me dull, or I begin to see that explanations have no value at all. So in this process I have become extraordinarily sensitive to any explanation. I am allergic!</p>
<p>There is a danger in this too, because, you know, people have said when you go to the guru he gives; so be silent and you will receive. That’s an illusion, you know. Well, I have said enough.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I could just say that when one sees that this whole process of time and knowledge and so on won’t work, then it stops. Now, this leaves one more sensitive - right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, the mind has become sharp.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All this movement was getting in the way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, psychological knowledge has made us dull.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It has kept the brain moving in an unnecessary way.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>All knowledge?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, no. You could say in some sense that knowledge needn’t make you dull, I suppose, if it starts from the clarity of where we don’t have this knowledge at the core...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. You remember we said too, in our discussions, that the ground is not knowledge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see the first thing is, it creates emptiness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But not yet the ground, not immediately the ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. You see, we have discussed all this; I hear it on the tape, it is printed in a book, and I say, yes I get it. By reading it, I have explained, I have acquired knowledge. Then I say, I must have that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The danger is that there is great difficulty in communicating this in a book because that is too fixed.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But that is what generally happens.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I think that the main point, which could communicate it, is to see that knowledge, in all its forms, subtle and obvious, cannot solve the psychological problem; it can only make it worse. But then there is another energy which is involved.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see now what is happening? If any trouble arises I go to a psychologist. In any family trouble I go to somebody who will tell me what to do. Everything around me is being organized, and making me more and more helpless. That is what is happening.</p>

<h1>5. The Ground of Being, and the Mind of Man</h1>

<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>Perhaps we could go further into the nature of the ground; whether we could come to it and whether it has any relationship to human beings. And also whether there could be a change in the physical behaviour of the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Could we approach this question from the point of view, why do we have ideas? And is the ground an idea? That is where we must first be clear. Why have ideas become so important?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps because the distinction between ideas, and what is beyond ideas, is not clear. Ideas are often taken to be something more than ideas; we feel they are not ideas but a reality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I want to find out. Is the ground an idea, or is it imagination, an illusion, a philosophic concept? Or something that is absolute, in the sense that there is nothing beyond it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>How can you tell that there is nothing beyond it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am coming to that. I want to see whether we look at that, or perceive that, or have an insight into that, from a concept. Because after all the whole Western world - perhaps also the Eastern world - is based on concepts. The whole outlook and religious beliefs, are based on that. But do we approach it from that point of view or as a philosophic investigation - philosophic, in the sense, love of wisdom, love of truth, love of investigation, the process of the mind? Are we doing that when we discuss, when we want to investigate, explain, or find out what that ground is?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, perhaps not all the philosophers have been basing their approach on concepts, although certainly philosophy is taught through concepts. Certainly it is very hard to teach it except through concepts.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What then is the difference between a religious mind and a philosophic mind? You understand what I am trying to convey? Can we investigate the ground from a mind that is disciplined in knowledge?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Fundamentally, inherently, we say that the ground is unknown. Therefore we can’t begin with knowledge, and we have suggested we start with the unknown.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Say for instance ‘X’ says there is such a ground. And all of us, ‘Y’ and ‘Z’, say, what is that ground, prove it, show it, let it manifest itself? When we ask such questions, is it with a mind that is seeking, or rather that has this passion, this love for truth? Or are we merely saying let’s talk about it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that in that mind there is the demand for certainty; we want to be sure. So there is no enquiring.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Suppose you state that there is such a thing, that there is the ground; it is immovable, etc. And I say, I want to find out. Show it, prove it to me. How can my mind, which has evolved through knowledge, which has been highly disciplined in knowledge, even touch that? Because that is not knowledge, it is not put together by thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, as soon as we say, prove it, we want to turn it into knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We want to be absolutely certain, so that there can be no doubt. And yet, on the other side of the coin, there is also the danger of self-deception and delusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. The ground cannot be touched as long as there is any form of illusion, which is the projection of desire, pleasure or fear. So how do I perceive that thing? Is the ground an idea to be investigated? Or is it something that cannot be investigated?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because my mind is trained, disciplined, by experience and knowledge, and it can only function in that area. And someone comes along and tells me that this ground is not an idea, is not a philosophic concept; it is not something that can be put together, or perceived by thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It cannot be experienced, it cannot be perceived or understood through thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what have I? What am I to do? I have only this mind that has been conditioned by knowledge. How am I to move away from all that? How am I, an ordinary man, educated, well-read, experienced, to feel this thing, to touch it, to comprehend it?</p>
<p>You tell me words will not convey that. You tell me you must have a mind that is free from all knowledge, except that which is technological. And you are asking an impossible thing of me, aren’t you? And, if I say I will make an effort, then that also is born out of the self-centred desire. So what shall I do? I think that is a very serious question. That is what every serious person asks.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>At least implicitly. They may not say it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, implicitly. So you, on the other side of the bank, as it were, tell me that there is no boat to cross in. You can’t swim across. In fact you can’t do anything. Basically, that is what it comes to. So what shall I do? You are asking me, you are asking the mind, not the general mind but...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...the particular mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You are asking this particular mind to eschew all knowledge. Has this ever been said in the Christian or the Jewish worlds?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I don’t know about the Jewish world, but in some sense the Christians tell you to give your faith to God, to give over to Jesus, as the mediator between us and God.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Now Vedanta means the end of knowledge. And being a Westerner, I say, it means nothing to me. Because from the Greeks and all that, the culture in which I have lived has emphasized knowledge. But when you talk to some Eastern minds, they acknowledge in their religious life that a time must come when knowledge must end; the mind must be free of knowledge. Vedanta is the whole way of looking. But it is only a conceptual, a theoretical understanding. But to a Westerner, it means absolutely nothing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that there has been a Western tradition which is similar, but not as common. For example, in the Middle Ages there was a book called The Cloud of Unknowing, which is on that line, although it is not the main line of Western thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what shall I do? How shall I approach the question? I want to find it. It gives meaning to life. It is not that my intellect gives meaning to life by inventing some illusion, some hope, some belief, but I see vaguely that this understanding, coming upon this ground, gives an immense significance to life.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, people have used that notion of God to give significance to life.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. God is merely an idea.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but the idea contains something similar to the Eastern idea that God is beyond knowing. Most people accept it that way, though some may not. So there is some sort of similar notion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But you tell me that the ground is not created by thought. So you cannot under any circumstances come upon it through any form of manipulation of thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I understand. But I am trying to say that there is this problem, danger, delusion, in the sense that people say, ‘Yes, that is quite true, it is through a direct experience of Jesus that we come upon it, not through the thought of God, you see!’ I am not able to express their view accurately. Possibly, the grace of God?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The grace of God, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Something beyond thought, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As a fairly educated, thoughtful man, I reject all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why do you reject it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because it has become common, first of all, common in the sense that everybody says that! And also there may be in it a great sense of illusion created by desire, hope, fear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but some people do seem to find this meaningful although it may be an illusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But if they had never heard of Jesus, they wouldn’t experience Jesus.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That seems reasonable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They would experience something different that they have been taught. In India I mean...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But don’t the more serious people in the religions say that essentially God, or whatever that is, the Absolute, the ground, is something that cannot be experienced through thinking? Also they might go so far as to say it cannot be experienced at all.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes, I have said it cannot be experienced. ‘X’ says it cannot be experienced. Let’s say, I don’t know. Here is a person who says there is such a thing. And I listen to him, and not only does he convey it by his presence, but through the word. Although he tells me to be careful; the word is not the thing; but he uses the word to convey that there is this something so immense that my thought cannot capture it. And I say, all right, you have explained that very carefully, and how is my brain, that is conditioned, disciplined in knowledge, how is it to free itself from all that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Could it free itself by understanding its own limitation?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So you are telling me thought is limited. Show it to me! Not by talking or memory, experience or knowledge; I understand that, but I don’t capture the feeling that it is limited, because I see the beauty of the earth, I see the beauty of a building, of a person, of nature. I see all that, but when you say thought is limited, I don’t feel it. It is just a lot of words which you have said to me. Intellectually I understand. But I have no feeling for it. There is no perfume in it. How will you show me - not show me - how will you help me - not help - aid me, to have this feeling that thought itself is brittle, it is such a small affair? So that it is in my blood - you understand? When once it is in my blood, I have got it. You don’t have to explain it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But isn’t that the possible approach, not to talk about the ground, that at the moment is far too removed, but rather to look directly at what the mind can do.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which is thinking.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>The mind is thinking.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is all I have. Thinking, feeling, hating, loving - you know all that. The activity of the mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well, I would say we don’t know it, we only think we know it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know when I am angry. I know when I am wounded. It is not an idea, I have got the feeling, I am carrying the hurt inside me. I am fed up with the investigation because I have done it all my life. I go to Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam - and I say I have investigated, studied, looked at them. I say these are all just words. How do I as a human being have this extraordinary feeling about it? If I have no passion, I am not investigating. I want to have this passion that will explode me out of this little enclosure. I have built a wall around myself, a wall, which is myself. And man has lived with this thing for millions of years. And I have been trying to get out of it by studying, by reading, by going to gurus, by all kinds of things, but I am still anchored there. And you talk about the ground, because you see something that is breathtaking, that seems so alive, so extraordinary. And I am here, anchored in here. You, who have ‘seen’ the ground, must do something that will explode, break up this centre completely.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I must do something, or you must?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Help me! Not by prayer, and all that nonsense. You understand what I am trying to say? I have fasted, I have meditated, I have renounced, I have taken a vow of this and that. I have done all those things. Because I have had a million years of life. And at the end of the million years I am still where I was, at the beginning. This is a great discovery for me; I thought I had moved on from the beginning, by going through all this, but I suddenly discover I am back at the same point where I started. I have had more experience, I have seen the world, I have painted, I have played music, I have danced - you follow? But I have come back to the original starting point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Which is me and not me.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Me. I say to myself, what am I to do? And what is the human mind’s relationship to the ground? Perhaps if I could establish a relationship it might break up this centre, totally. This is not a motive, not a desire, not a reward. I see that if the mind could establish a relationship with that, my mind has become that - right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But hasn’t mind then already become that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But I think you have just wiped away the greatest difficulty in saying there is no desire.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. I said I have lived a million years...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But that is an insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. I won’t accept insight so easily as that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well, let me put it this way: it is something much more than knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, you are missing my point. My brain has lived for a million years. It has experienced everything. It has been Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, Muslim; it has been all kinds of things, but the core of it is the same. And someone comes along and says, look there is a ground which is... something! Am I going back to what I have already known - the religions, etc.? I reject all that, because I say I have been through it all, and they are like ashes to me at the end of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, all those things were the attempt to create an apparent ground by thought. It seemed that through knowledge and thought, people created what they regarded as the ground. And it wasn’t.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It wasn’t. Because man has spent a million years at it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So long as knowledge enters the ground, that will be false?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. So is there a relationship between that ground and the human mind? In asking that question, I am also aware of the danger of such a question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, you may create a delusion of the same kind that we have already gone through.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I have played that song before.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Are you suggesting that the relationship cannot be made by you, but it must come...?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am asking that. No, it may be that I have to make a relationship. My mind now is in such a state that I won’t accept a thing. My mind says I have been through all this before. I have suffered, I have searched, I have looked, I have investigated, I have lived with people who are awfully clever at this kind of thing. So I am asking the question, being fully aware of the danger of it, as when the Hindus say, God is in you, Brahman is in you - which is a lovely idea! But I have been through all that.</p>
<p>So I am asking if the human mind has no relationship to the ground, and if there is only a one-way passage, from that to me...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Surely that’s like the grace of God then, that you have invented.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That I won’t accept.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You are not saying the relationship is one way, nor are you saying it is not one way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Maybe; I don’t know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You are not saying anything.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not saying anything. All that I ‘want’ is this centre to be blasted. You understand? For the centre not to exist. Because I see that the centre is the cause of all the mischief, all the neurotic conclusions, all the illusions, all the endeavour, all the effort, all the misery - everything is from that core. After a million years, I haven’t been able to get rid of it; it hasn’t gone. So is there a relationship at all? What is the relationship between goodness and evil? Consider it. There is no relationship.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It depends on what you mean by relationship.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Contact, touch, communication, being in the same room...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...coming from the same root.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But are we then saying that there is the good, and there is the evil?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. Let’s use another word; whole, and that which is not whole. It is not an idea. Now is there relationship between these two? Obviously not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, if you are saying that in some sense the centre is an illusion. An illusion cannot be related to that which is true, because the content of the illusion has no relation to what is true.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. You see, that is a great discovery. I want to establish relationship with that. ‘Want’; I am using rapid words to convey something. This petty little thing wants to have relationship with that immensity. It cannot.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, not just because of its immensity, but because in fact this thing is not - actually?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But I don’t see that. He says the centre is not actual, but I don’t see that the centre is not actual.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not actual, in the sense of not being genuine but an illusion. I mean, something is acting but it is not the content which we know.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Do you see that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You say the centre must explode. It does not explode because I don’t see the falseness in it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. You have missed my point. I have lived a million years, I have done all this. And at the end of it I am still back at the beginning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>So you say the centre must explode.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no, no. The mind says this is too terribly small. And it can’t do anything about it... It has prayed, it has done everything. But the centre is still there. And someone tells me there is this ground. I want to establish a relationship with that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>He tells me there is this thing, and also says that the centre is an illusion.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Wait, that is too quick.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Wait. I know it is there. Call it what you like, an illusion, a reality, a fiction - whatever you like. It is there. And the mind says, it is not good enough; it wants to capture that. It wants to have relationship with it. And that says, ‘Sorry, you can’t have relationship with me.’ That’s all!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Is that mind which wants to be in connection, in relationship with that, the same mind which is the ‘me’?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don’t split it up, please. You are missing something. I have lived all this. I know, I can argue with you, back and forth. I have a million years of experience, and it has given me a certain capacity. And I realize at the end of it all there is no relationship between me and truth. And that’s a tremendous shock to me. It is as if you have knocked me out, because my million years of experience say, go after that, seek it, pray for it, struggle for it, cry, sacrifice for it. I have done all that. And suddenly it is pointed out that I cannot have relationship with that. I have shed tears, left my family, everything, for that. And that says, ‘No relationship’. So what has happened to me? This is what I want to get at. Do you understand what I am saying - what has happened to me? To the mind that has lived this way, done everything in search of that, when that says, ‘You have no relationship with me’. This is the greatest thing...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>It is a tremendous shock to the ‘me’, if you say that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it to you?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I think it was, and then...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don’t! I am asking you, is it a shock to discover that your brain, and your mind, your knowledge, are valueless? All your examinations, all your struggles, all the things that you have gathered through years and years, centuries, are absolutely worthless? Do you go mad, because you say you have done all this for nothing? Virtue, abstinence, control, everything - and at the end of it, you say they are valueless! Do you understand what this does to you?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I mean, if the whole thing goes, then it is of no consequence.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Absolutely, you have no relationship. What you have done or not done is absolutely of no value.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not in any fundamental sense. It has relative value, relative value only within a certain framework, which in itself has no value.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, thought has relative value.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But the framework in general has no value.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. The ground says, whatever you have done ‘on earth’ has no meaning. Is that an idea? Or an actuality? Idea being that you have told me, but I still go on, struggling, wanting, groping. Or is it an actuality, in the sense that I suddenly realize the futility of all that I have done. So, one must be very careful to see that it is not a concept; or rather that one doesn’t translate it into a concept or an idea, but receive the full blow of it!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You see, Krishnaji, for hundreds of years, probably since man has existed, he has pursued what he calls God, or the ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As an idea.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But then the scientific mind came along, and also said it is just an idea, it is just foolish.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no! The scientific mind says that through investigating matter we will perhaps come upon the ground.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, many feel that way. Some would even add, investigate the brain, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That is the purpose of investigating the mind, not to blast each other off the earth, with guns. We are talking of ‘good’ scientists, not governmental scientists, but those who say, we are examining matter, the brain and all that, to find out if there is something beyond all this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>And many people, many scientists, would say that they have found the ground; the ground is empty, it is emptiness; it is an energy which is different from man.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now, is that an idea, or an actuality to them, which affects their life, their blood, their mind, their relationship with the world?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I think it is just an idea.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then I am sorry, I have been through that. I was a scientist ten thousand years ago! You follow? I have been through all that. If it is merely an idea, we can both play at that game. I can send the ball to you, it is in your court, and you can send it back to me. We can play that. But I have finished with that kind of game.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because, in general, what people discover about matter does not seem to affect them deeply, psychologically.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, of course not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You might think that if they saw the whole unity of the universe they would act differently, but they don’t.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You could say that it has affected some of their lives. You see the whole Communist doctrine is built on the idea (which they think is a fact) that whatever is, is just a material process, which is essentially empty. So then man has to organize his life and society according to those dialectical principles.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no, dialectical principles are opinion opposing another opinion; man hoping, out of opinions, to find the truth.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think we should leave this aside. There are ways of looking at different meanings of the word dialectical - but one needs to see reality as a flowing movement; not to see things as fixed, but to see them in movement and interconnection. I think that you could say that whatever way people managed to look at it, after they saw this unity it didn’t fundamentally change their lives. In Russia, the same structures of the mind, if not worse, hold as elsewhere. And wherever people have tried this, it has not actually, fundamentally, affected the way they feel and think, and the way they live.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You see, what I wanted to say is that the dismissal of the pursuit of the ground has not had any shocking effect on people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No! I am not interested. It has given me a tremendous shock to discover the truth, that all the churches, prayers, books, have absolutely no meaning - except how we can build a better society, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If we could manage to bring this point to order, then it would have great meaning - to build a good society. But as long as this disorder is at the centre, we can’t use that in the right way. I think it would be more accurate to say that there is a great potential meaning in all that. But it does not affect the centre, and there is no sign that it has ever done so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You see what I don’t understand is that there are many people who in their life have never pursued what you call the ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They are not interested.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well, I am not so sure. How would you approach such a person?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not interested in approaching any person. All the works I have done - everything I have done - the ground says are valueless. And if I can drop all that, my mind is the ground. Then from there I move. From there I create society.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think you could say that as long as you are looking for the ground somewhere by means of knowledge, then you are getting in the way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So to come back to earth; why has man done this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Done what?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Accumulated knowledge. Apart from the necessity of having factual knowledge in certain areas, why has this burden of knowledge continued for so long?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because in one sense man has been trying to produce a solid ground through knowledge. Knowledge has tried to create a ground. That is one of the things that has happened.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It means illusion again.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means that the saints, the philosophers, have educated me - in knowledge and through knowledge - to find the ground.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>To create a ground. You see, in a way, there used to be all these periods when mankind was caught in superstition. And knowledge was able to do away with that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>To some extent it was.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Knowledge has only crippled me from seeing truth. I stick to that. It hasn’t cleared me of my illusions. Knowledge may be illusory itself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>That may be, but it has cleared up some illusions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want to clear up all the illusions that I hold - not some. I have got rid of my illusion about nationalism; I have got rid of illusion about belief, about this, about that. At the end of it, I realize my mind is illusion. You see, to me, who have lived for a thousand years, to find all this is absolutely worthless, is something enormous.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>When you say you have lived for a thousand years, or a million years, does that mean, in a sense, that all the experience of mankind is...?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...is me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...is me. Do you feel that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I do.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And how do you feel it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How do we feel anything? Wait a minute, I will tell you. It is not sympathy, or empathy, it is not a thing that I have desired, it is a fact, an absolute, irrevocable fact.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Could we share that feeling, perhaps? You see, that seems to be one of the steps that is missing, because you have repeated that quite often as an important part of the whole thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means that when you love somebody there is no ‘me’ - it is love. In the same way, when I say I am humanity, it is so; it is not an idea, it is not a conclusion, it is part of me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s say it is a feeling that I have gone through all that, all that you describe.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Human beings have been through all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If others have gone through it, then I also have gone through it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. One is not aware of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, we separate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If we admit that our brains are not my particular brain, but the brain that has evolved through millennia...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let me say why this doesn’t communicate so easily: everybody feels that the content of his brain is in some way individual, that he hasn’t gone through all that. Let’s say that somebody, thousands of years ago, went through science or philosophy. Now how does that affect me? That is what is not clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because I am caught in this self-centred, narrow little cell, which refuses to look beyond. But you as a scientist, as a religious man, come along and tell me that your brain is the brain of mankind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and all knowledge is the knowledge of mankind. So that in some way we have all knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Though not in detail.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So you tell me that, and I understand what you mean, not verbally, not intellectually; it is so. But I come to that only when I have given up ordinary things, like nationality, etc.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, we have given up the divisions, and we can see that the experience is of all mankind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is so obvious. You go to the most primitive village in India, and the peasant will tell you all about his problems, his wife, children, poverty. It is exactly the same thing, only he is wearing different clothes or whatever! For ‘X’, this is an indisputable fact; it is so. He says, all right, at the end of all this, of all these years, I suddenly discover that it is empty. You see, we don’t accept it, we are too clever. We are so soaked with disputations and arguments and knowledge. We don’t see a simple fact. We refuse to see it. And ‘X’ comes along and says, see it, it is there: then the immediate machinery of thought begins - and says, be silent. So I practise silence! I have done that for a thousand years. It has led nowhere.</p>
<p>So there is only one thing, and that is to discover that all that I have done is useless - ashes! You see that doesn’t depress one. That is the beauty of it. I think it is like the Phoenix.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Rising from the ashes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Born of ashes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In a way it is freedom, to be free of all that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Something totally new is born.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now what you said before is that the mind is the ground, it is the unknown.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The mind? Yes. But not this mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In that case it is not the same mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If I have been through all that, and come to a point when I have to end all that, it is a new mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s clear, the mind is its content, and the content is knowledge, and without that knowledge it is a new mind.</p>

<h1>6. Can Insight Bring About a Mutation of the Brain Cells?</h1>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>You have said that insight changes the brain cells, and I wonder if we could discuss that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As it is constituted, the brain functions in one direction: memory, experience, knowledge. It has functioned in that area as much as possible, and most people are satisfied with it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, they don’t know of anything else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And also they have placed knowledge in supreme importance. If one is concerned with fundamental change, where does one begin? Suppose ‘X’ feels he will go along a certain direction set by mankind. He has been going there century after century, and he asks himself what is radical change; if it is in the environment, or in human relationships; if it is a sense of love, which is not in the area of knowledge. Where is it to begin? You understand my question? Unless there is some mutation taking place inside here, inside my mind, the brain, I may think I have changed, but it is a superficial change, and not a change in depth.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. What is implied there is that the present state of affairs involves not only the mind but also the nervous system and the body. Everything is set in a certain way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. That is what I meant, the whole movement is set in a certain way. And along that pattern I can modify, adjust, polish a little more, a little less and so on. But if a man is concerned with radical change, where is he to begin? As we said the other day, we have relied on the environment or society and various disciplines to change us, but I feel these are all in the same direction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In so far as they all emanate from this thing, the way the mind and body are set, they are not going to change anything. There is a total structure involved which is in the brain, in the body, in the whole of society.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, yes. So what am I to do? What is ‘X’ to do? And in asking this question, what is there to change?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What exactly do you mean by ‘what is there to change’? What is to be changed?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, both; what is there to be changed, and what is there to change? Basically, what is there to change? ‘X’ sees that he can change certain things along this way, but to go much further than that, what is one to do? I am sure man has asked this question. You must have asked it. But apparently the mutation hasn’t taken place. So what is ‘X’ to do? He realizes the need for a radical revolution, a psychological revolution; he perceives that the more he changes, it is the same thing continuing; the more he enquires into himself, the enquiry remains the same, and so on. So what is there to change; unless ‘X’ finds a way to change the brain itself?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But what will change the brain?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. The brain has been set in a pattern for millennia! I think it is no longer ‘what’ should I change. It is imperative that I change.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So it is agreed that there must be a change, but the question is still, how can the brain change?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>One must come to that point. If this question is put to you as a scientist, or as a human being who is involved in science, what would your answer be?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I don’t think science can deal with it, because it doesn’t go far enough. It can’t possibly probe that deeply into the structure of the brain. Many questions are positing the relationship of brain and mind, which science has not been able to resolve. Some people would say that there is nothing beyond the brain...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...Purely materialistic; I understand all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If it is not materialistic, then for the moment science has very little to say about it. Perhaps some people would try to, but science generally has been most successful, most systematic, in dealing with matter. Any attempt to do otherwise is not very clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So you would tell ‘X’, to change inside in the brain cells, etc. My immediate answer to that is, how? Everybody asks that. It is not a matter of faith. It is not a matter of changing one pattern to another pattern. So you leave me without any direction - right? You leave me without any instrument that can penetrate this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Except that you are implying there is something beyond the brain, in putting that question. We don’t know. The very statement implies that insight is somehow beyond the brain, else it couldn’t change the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So how am I to capture it? Maybe I can’t capture it...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...but how will it come about? You are saying that something that is non-material can affect matter. This is the implication.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not sure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that clearing this up, would make more clear what your question is. It is somewhat puzzling if you don’t.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All that you have said to me is, insight changes, brings about mutation in the brain. Now you explain what insight is, which is not a result of a progressive knowledge, not progressive time, not a remembrance. This insight may be the real activity of the brain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All right. Let’s put it differently. The brain has many activities which include memory, and all these that you have mentioned. In addition there is a more inward activity, but it is still the activity of the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It may be the same.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, in putting this, something seems to be not quite clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. We must be very clear that it is not the result of progressive knowledge; it is not come by through any exercise of will.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Agreed. I think people can generally see that insight comes in a flash, it does not come through will. Those who have considered it at all can see that. Also, that chemistry will probably not bring it about.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think most people who are concerned see that. But how am I, as ‘X’, to have this insight? I see your logic, I see your reason.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In some ways it may disturb people. It is not clear what the logic is, what is going to make this change in the brain. Is it something more than the brain, or is it something deeper in the brain? This is one of the questions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not quite clear logically.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Are you saying that there is a function of the brain which acts without reference to its content?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, to the past, to the content.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This is a good question. Is there a function in the brain which is independent of the content? Which is not conditioned by the content, but that might still be a physical function?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand. Is this the question? Apart from the consciousness with its content, is there in the brain an activity which is not touched by consciousness?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>By the content; yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Content is the consciousness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but sometimes we use the word in another sense. Sometimes we imply that there could be another kind of consciousness. So if we call it ‘content’ it would be more clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. A part of the brain which is not touched by the content.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, this suggests that it may be possible for the brain to change. Either the brain is entirely controlled by its content, or in some way it is not conditioned.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is a dangerous concept!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it is what you are saying.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. See the danger of it. See the danger of admitting to oneself that there is a part of the brain...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...an activity...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...all right, an activity of the brain which is not touched by the content.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is a possible activity. It may be that it has not been awakened.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It has not been awakened. That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But what is the danger?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is simple enough. The danger is that I am admitting there is God in me, that there is something superhuman; something beyond the content which therefore will operate on it, or that will operate in spite of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But which part of the brain sees the danger?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let us go slowly. Which part of the brain sees the danger? Of course it is the content that sees the danger.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Does it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes, because the content is aware of all the tricks it has played.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This is similar to many of the old tricks.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Those tricks we have discussed before - the assumption of God within, the imagination of God within. There is a danger here obviously.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But could the brain, seeing the danger, make that statement nevertheless? Because that statement might be pointing to the right direction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Even though it is dangerous, it may be necessary to do so; it may be on the right track.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The unconscious, which is part of the content, may capture this, and say, ‘Yes’ - so it sees the danger instantly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>It sees its own trap.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, it sees the trap which it has created. So it avoids that trap. That is sanity: to avoid a trap is sanity. Is there an activity which is totally independent of the content? Then, is that activity part of the brain?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Is it a natural activity of the brain? Material in the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, if there is such a natural activity, it could awaken somehow, and that activity could change the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But would you say it is still material?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. There could be different levels of matter, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am trying to get at. Right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you see, if you think that way, there could be a deeper level of matter which is not conditioned by the content. For example, we know matter in the universe is not conditioned by the content of our brains generally. There could be a deeper level of matter not conditioned in that way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So it would still be matter, refined, or ‘super’, or whatever; it would still be the content.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why do you say that? You see, you have to go slowly. Do you say that matter is content?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Inherently? But this has to be made clear, because it is not obvious.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s discuss it. Let’s grip this. Thought is matter.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, thought is part of the content, part of the material process. Whether it exists independently as matter is not so clear. You can say, water is matter; you can pour water from one glass to another, it has an independent substance. But it is not clear whether thought could stand as matter by itself, except with some other material substance like the brain in which it takes place. Is that clear?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t quite follow.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If you say water is matter, then it is clear. Now if you say, thought is matter, then thought must have a similar independent substance. You say air is matter - right? Or water is matter. Now waves are not matter, they are just a process in matter. Is it clear what I mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. A wave is a process in matter.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>A material process. Is thought matter, or is it a process in matter?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>May one ask, is electricity considered to be matter?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In so far as there are electron particles it is matter, but it is also a movement of that, which is a process.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>So it is two things.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well you can form waves of electricity, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Waves would be the matter, but not the electrical action.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The electrical action is like the waves, but the electricity consists of particles.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is the question we are now asking?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Is thought a material substance, or is it a process in some other material substance - like the brain?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is a material process in the brain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, scientists would generally agree with that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s stick to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If you say it is matter, they would become very puzzled.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I see.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>It doesn’t exist apart from the brain cells. It resides in the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is, thought is a material process in the brain. That would be right. Then can that material process ever be independent?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Independent of what?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Independent of something that is not a material process. No, wait a minute, we must go slowly. Thought is a material process in the brain. We all agree about this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, you would get very wide agreement on that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then our question is, can that material process in the brain bring about a change in itself?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is the question.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In itself. And if that material in itself can change, it would still be a material process. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Thought is always apparently going to be a material process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And therefore it is not insight. We must come back to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You are saying that insight is not a material process?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Go slowly. We must be careful in using words. Thought is a material process in the brain; and any other movement, springing from that material process, is still material.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it has to be.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Right. Is there another activity which is not a material process?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Of course people have asked that question for ages. Is there spirit beyond matter?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Spirit, Holy Ghost! Is there some other activity of the brain which cannot be related to the material process?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it cannot depend upon it. Insight cannot depend on the material process, as it would then be just another material process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Insight cannot depend on the material process, which is thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you were putting it the other way round, that the material process may depend on insight, may be changed by insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, wait. The material process is dependent on it, but insight is not dependent on that process.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now many people would not see how something non-material would affect something material.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It might be easily agreed that something non-material is not affected by matter, but then how does the operation work the other way?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What do you say? The brain, thought, with its content, is a material process. Any activity from it is still part of that. Now is insight part of that too?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have agreed on its independence of that; it can’t be part of it. But it can still act within the material process, that’s the crucial thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That’s right. Insight is independent of the material process, but yet it can act upon it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s discuss that a little. Generally speaking, in science, if ‘A’ can act on ‘B’ there is usually reciprocal action of ‘B’ on ‘A’. We don’t find situations where ‘A’ acts on ‘B’, but ‘B’ never acts on ‘A’.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I see, I see.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This is one of the difficulties you have raised. We don’t find this elsewhere; in human relations, if I can act on you, you can act on me - right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, we see that human relationships are interaction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, mutual relationships.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And in those relationships there is response, and so on. Now, if I don’t respond to your action, I am independent of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you see, science generally finds that it is not possible to have a one-sided action.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. So we are continually insisting that the material process must have a relationship to the other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>An action, anyway. Relationship is an ambiguous word here. If you said action it would be more clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. The material process must be able to act on the non-material, and the non-material must act on the material.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But that would make them both the same.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Exactly!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Not necessarily. One could envisage that insight is a much larger movement than the material process of the brain, and therefore that the larger movement can act on the smaller movement, but the smaller cannot act on the larger.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, we are saying the same thing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The small movement has no significant action on the larger movement. You can have a situation that if you drop a rock in the ocean, the ocean absorbs it with no significant change.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>So then they would still have a two-way action but only one action would be significant.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. Don’t enter into that too quickly, let us be careful. Love has no relationship to hate.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Again there is this word ‘relationship’. Would you, for example, say that hate has no action on love?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They are independent.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Independent, they have no action on each other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, it is a very important thing to discover this. Love is independent of hate. Where there is hate the other cannot exist.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, they can’t stand side by side, acting on each other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They can’t. So when scientists say, if ‘A’ has a relationship to ‘B’, then ‘B’ must have a relationship to ‘A’, we are contradicting that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not all scientists have said that; a few have said otherwise - I don’t like to bring in Aristotle...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Bring him in!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>He said there is an unmoved mover, that God is never moved by matter; he is not acted on by matter, but he acts. Do you see? That is an old idea then. Since Aristotle’s time, science has thrown out this concept, and said that it is impossible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If I see clearly that love is independent of hate, hate cannot possibly act on love. Love may act on hate, but where hate is, the other cannot be.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, those are two possibilities. Which are you saying?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What are the two possibilities?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You said, one possibility is that love may act on hate, and the other is that they have no action at all on each other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But which?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand. No, love cannot act on hate.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right. They have no relationship. But perhaps insight could, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have to be quite clear on this point. Violence, and being without violence, are two entirely different factors. One cannot act upon the other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In that case you could say that the existence of the one is the non-existence of the other, and there is no way in which they can act together.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They cannot be there together.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Absolutely. I’ll stick to that. So when this material process is in action, the other cannot exist.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What is ‘the other’ this time? Insight?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That denies what we were saying before; that there is an action from insight on the material process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now, steady, yes. Where there is violence the other - I hate to use the word ‘non-violence’ - is not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Peace, or harmony?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Where there is violence, peace cannot exist. But where there is peace, is there violence? No, of course not. So peace is independent of violence.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You have said many, many times that intelligence can act upon thought; insight can affect thought, but it doesn’t work the other way round. You have given many examples of this.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Intelligence can wipe away ignorance, but ignorance cannot touch intelligence - right? Where there is love, hate can never exist. Can love wipe away hate?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We said that this doesn’t seem to be possible, because hate appears to be an independent force.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It has its own momentum, you see, its own force, its own movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I don’t quite get this relationship of love and hate with the earlier discussion of insight.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There seem to be two different areas.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Thought is a movement, and insight seems to be non-movement, where everything seemingly is at rest, and it can observe movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is what we are trying to get at, the notion of something which is not affected by anything else.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Aren’t you then saying, in looking at love and hate, that there is good and there is evil, and that evil is a completely separate, independent force?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it is independent of good.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But is the process in the mind, or is it related to insight?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We are coming to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Take light and darkness. Light appears, and the darkness is gone.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Good and evil; love and hate; light and darkness - when one is, the other can’t be, you see. That is all we are saying so far.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Do you mean, in a single brain?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In any brain, yes, or in any group, or anywhere. Whenever there is hate going on in a group, there is not love.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Something has just come to my mind. Love has no cause. Hate has a cause. Insight has no cause. The material process, as thought, has a cause. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it is part of the chain of cause and effect.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can that which has no cause ever act upon that which has a cause?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It might. We can see no reason why that which has no cause might not act on something that has a cause. There is no obvious reason. It won’t happen the other way round. What has a cause cannot act on that which has no cause, because that would invalidate it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. But apparently the action of insight has an extraordinary effect on the material process.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It may for example wipe out some causes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As insight is causeless, it has a definite effect on that which has cause.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it doesn’t necessarily follow, but it is possible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no, I don’t say it is possible.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I am saying we haven’t quite seen why it is necessary. There is no contradiction when we say the word possible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right, I see. As long as we are clear on the word possible. We must be careful. Love is without cause, and hate has a cause. The two cannot coexist.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. That is true. That is why there is a difference between love and insight. That is why it doesn’t follow necessarily that if something has no cause it will act on something that has a cause. That is what I was trying to say.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I just want to explore a little more. Is love insight?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>As far as we can see it is not the same. Love and insight are not identical, are they? Not exactly the same thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Insight may be love, but, you see, insight also occurs in a flash.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is a flash of course. And that flash alters the whole pattern, operates on it, uses the pattern, in the sense that I argue, reason, use logic, and all that. I don’t know if I am making myself clear?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that once the flash has operated, the pattern is different, and would therefore be more rational. The flash may make logic possible, because you may have been confused before the flash.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, yes! Aristotle may have come to all this by logic.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, he may have had some insight! We don’t know.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We don’t know, but I am questioning it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We really don’t know how his mind operated because there are only a few books that have survived.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would you say by reading some of those books that he had insight?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I haven’t really read Aristotle directly; very few people have because it is hard. Most people read what other people have said about Aristotle. A few phrases of his are common, like ‘the unmoved mover’. And he has said some things which suggest that he was quite intelligent, at least.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What I am trying to say is that insight is never partial; I am talking of total, not partial, insight.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Krishnaji, could you explain that a little? What do you mean by ‘not partial’ insight?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>An artist can have a partial insight. A scientist can have a partial insight. But we are talking about total insight.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You see the artist is also a human being, so...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But his capture of insight is partial.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>It is directed to some form of art. So you mean that it illuminates a limited area, or subject. Is that what you mean by partial insight?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Then what would be total insight? What would it encompass?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The total human activity.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is one point. But earlier on, we were asking whether this insight would illuminate the brain, the activity of the brain. In that illumination, it seems that the material activity of the brain will change. Would that be correct? We must get this point clear, then we can raise the question of totality. Are we saying that insight is an energy which illuminates the activity of the brain? And that in this illumination, the brain itself begins to act differently.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You are quite right. That’s all. That is what takes place. Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We say the source of this illumination is not in the material process; it has no cause.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No cause.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it is a real energy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is pure energy. Is there action without cause?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, without time. Cause implies time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is, this flash has altered completely the pattern which the material process has set.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Could you say that the material process generally operates in a kind of darkness, and therefore it has set itself on a wrong path?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In darkness, yes. That is clear. The material process acts in ignorance, in darkness. And this flash of insight enlightens the whole field, which means that ignorance and darkness have been dispelled. I will hold to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You could say, then, that darkness and light cannot coexist for obvious reasons. Nevertheless the very existence of light is to change the process of darkness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But what contributes the flash?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We haven’t come to that yet. I want to go step by step into this. What has happened is that the material process has worked in darkness, and has brought about confusion, and all the mess that exists in the world. But this flash of insight wipes away the darkness. Which means that the material process is not then working in darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right. But now let’s make another point clear. When the flash has gone, the light continues.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The light is there, the flash is the light.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>At a certain moment the flash is immediate, but then, as you work from there, there is still light.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why do you differentiate flash from light?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Simply because the word ‘flash’ suggests something that happens in one moment.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, we are saying that insight would only last in that moment.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We must go slowly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it is a matter of language.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it merely a matter of language?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps not, but if you use the word ‘flash’, there is the analogy of lightning, giving light for a moment, but then the next moment you are in darkness, until there is a further flash of lightning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is not like that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So what is it? Is it that the light suddenly turns on, and stays on?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Because when we say ‘stays on’ or ‘goes off’, we are thinking in terms of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to clear this up, because it is the question everybody will put.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The material process is working in darkness, in time, in knowledge, in ignorance and so on. When insight takes place there is the dispelling of that darkness. That is all we are saying. Insight dispels that darkness. And thought, which is the material process, no longer works in darkness. Therefore that light has altered - no, it has ended - ignorance.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So we say that this darkness is really something which is built into the content of thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The content is darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s right. Then that light has dispelled that ignorance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. Dispelled the content.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But still we have to be very careful, in case we still have content in the usually accepted sense of the word; you know, all kinds of things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So we can’t say that the light has dispelled all the content.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It has dispelled the centre of darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the source, the creator of darkness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The self. Right? It has dispelled the centre of darkness which is the self.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We could say that the self, which is part of the content - that part of the content which is the centre of darkness, which creates it and maintains it - is dispelled.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I hold to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We see now that this means a physical change in the brain cells. That centre, that content which is the centre, is a certain set, form, disposition of all the brain cells, and it in some way alters.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously! You see, this has enormous significance, in our relationship with our society, in everything. Now the next question is, how does this flash come about? Let’s begin the other way round. How does love come about? How does peace come about? Peace is causeless, violence has cause. How does that causeless thing come about when my whole life is causation? There is no ‘how’ - right? The ‘how’ implies a cause, so there is no ‘how’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Are you saying that since it is without cause, it is something that just exists...?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I don’t say that it exists. That is a dangerous statement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>It has to exist at some point.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. The moment you say it exists, it is not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, the danger is that it is part of the content.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The question you put was about a mutation in the brain cells. That question has been put after a series of discussions. And we have come to a point when we say that the flash, that light, has no cause; that the light operates on that which has cause, which is the darkness. That darkness exists as long as the self is there, it is the originator of that darkness, but light dispels the very centre of darkness. That’s all. We have come to that point. And therefore there is a mutation. Then I say that the question of how do I get this flash of insight, how does it happen, is a wrong question. There is no ‘how’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>There is no ‘how’, but there is darkness and there is light.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Just see first there is no ‘how’. If you show me how, you are back into the darkness. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is a tremendous thing to understand that. I am asking something else, which is, why is it that we have no insight at all? Why is it that this insight doesn’t start from our childhood?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, the way life is lived...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I want to find out. Is it because of our education? Our society? I don’t believe it is all that. You follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What do you say then?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it some other factor? I am groping after this. Why don’t we have it? It seems so natural.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>At first, one would say something is interfering with it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it seems so natural. For ‘X’, it is quite natural. Why isn’t it natural for everyone? Why isn’t it possible? If we talk about blockages, education, etc., which are all in the realm of causation, then to remove the blockages implies another cause. So we keep on rolling in that direction. There is something unnatural about all this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>If you would say that there are blocks...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t want to use that; it is the language of the darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Then you could say that the blocks prevent the insight from acting.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. But I want to move away from these blockages.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not exactly blockages, but we used the words ‘centre of darkness’, which we say is maintaining darkness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why isn’t it natural for everybody to have this insight?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is the question.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why is love not natural to everybody? Am I putting the question clearly?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think, to make it more clear, some people might feel that it is natural to everybody, but being treated in a certain way they gradually get caught in hate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t believe that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then you would have to suppose that the young child meeting hate would not respond with hate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Most people would say that it is natural for the young child meeting hate to respond with hate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, this morning I heard that. Then I asked myself why? Now just a minute. ‘X’ has been put under all these circumstances, which could have produced blockages, but ‘X’ wasn’t touched by them. So why is it not possible for everybody?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We should make it clear why we say it would be natural not to respond to hate with hate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. Limit it to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Even when one hasn’t thought about it. You know, the child is not able to think about all this. Some people would say it is instinct, the animal instinct...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...which is to hate...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...well, to fight back.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To fight back.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The animal will respond with love, if you treat him with love, but if you treat the animal with hate he is going to fight back.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>He will become vicious.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now some people would say that the human being in the beginning is like that animal, and later he can understand.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. That is, the human being’s origins were with the animal, and the animal, the ape or the wolf...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...the wolf will respond with love too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And we are saying, why...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Look, almost everybody feels that what I said is true, that when we are very young children, we are like the animal. Now you are asking, why don’t all young children immediately fail to respond to hate with hate?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That means, is it the fault of the parents?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What you are implying is that it is not entirely that. There must be something deeper.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I think there is something quite different. I want to capture that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This is something that would be important.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How do we find out? Let’s have an insight! I feel that there is something totally different. We are attacking it from a causational point of view. Would it be right to say that the beginning of man is not animal?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that is not clear. The present theory of evolution is that there have been apes, developing; you can follow the line where they become more and more like human beings. Now when you say that the beginning of man is not animal, it is not clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If the beginning of man is the animal, therefore that instinct is natural and then it is highly cultivated.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that instinct is cause and effect.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Cause and effect, and it becomes natural. But someone comes along and asks ‘Is it?’</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s try to get this clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I mean, scientists and historians have said that man began from the ape, and that, as all animals respond to love and to hate, we as human beings respond instantly to hate by hate.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And vice versa, to love by love.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>At the beginning there were a few people who never responded to hate, because they had love. Those people implanted this thing in the human mind. Right? That where love is, hate is not. And that has also been part of our inheritance. Why have we cultivated the response of hate to hate? Why haven’t we cultivated the other? Or is the other - love - something that cannot be cultivated?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not causal. Cultivation depends on a cause.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>On thought. So why have we lost the other? We have cultivated very carefully, by thought, the concept of meeting hate by hate, violence by violence, and so on. Why haven’t we moved along with the other line? With love, that is causeless? You follow my question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is this a futile question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>One doesn’t see any way of proceeding.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not trying to proceed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to understand what made people respond to hate with hate...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...To ‘X’, the other seems so natural. So if that is so natural to him, why isn’t it natural to everyone else? It must be natural to others!</p>
<p>You know this ancient idea, which is probably in existence in the Jewish and in the Indian religions, and so on, that the manifestation of the highest takes place, occasionally. That seems too easy an explanation. Has mankind moved in the wrong direction? Have we taken a wrong turn?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, we have discussed this before, that there has been a wrong turning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To respond to hate by hate, violence by violence, etc.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And to give supreme value to knowledge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Wouldn’t another factor also be the attempt to cultivate the idea of love? The purpose of the religions has been to produce love, and better human beings.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don’t go into all that. Love has no cause, it is not cultivatable. Full stop.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Yes, but the mind doesn’t see that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But we have explained all that. I want to find out why, if it is natural to ‘X’, it isn’t natural to others. I think this is a valid question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Another point is to say that you could see that the response of hate to hate makes no sense anyway. So why do we go on with it? Because many believe in that moment that they are protecting themselves with hate, but it is no protection.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But to go back to that question: I think it is valid. ‘X’ is without cause, ‘Y’ is caught in cause. Why? You understand? Is it the privilege of the few? The elite? No, no. Let’s look at it another way. The mind of humanity has been responding to hate with hate, violence by violence, and knowledge by knowledge. But ‘X’ is part of humanity, and he does not respond to hate by hate, like ‘Y’ and ‘Z’! They are part of ‘X’s’ consciousness, part of all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why is there this difference?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am asking. One is natural, the other is unnatural. Why? Why the difference? Who is asking this question? The people, ‘Y’ and ‘Z’, who respond to hate by hate, are they asking the question? Or is ‘X’ asking the question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>It would seem that ‘X’ is asking this question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but you see we were also just saying that they are not different. We say they are different, but also that they are not different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. They are not different.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is one mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it, one mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and how does it come that another part of this one mind says no?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s the whole thing. How does it come about that one part of the mind says we are different from another? Of course, there are all kinds of explanations, and I am left with the fact that ‘A’ ‘B’ and ‘C’ are different from ‘X’ ‘Y’ and ‘Z’. And those are facts - right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>They appear to be different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>They are actually different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Absolutely; not just apparently.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think the question we want to come back to is, why do the people who cultivate hate say that they are different from those who don’t?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Do they say that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think they do, in so far as they would admit that if there was anybody who didn’t cultivate hate, they must be different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is clear - light and darkness, and so on. But I want to find out if we are moving in the right direction. That is, ‘X’ has given me that gift, and I have not carried that gift. You follow what I mean? I have cultivated one response, but not carried this. Why? If a father has responded to hate by hate, why has the son not responded in the same way?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think it is a question of insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means that the son had insight right from the beginning. You follow what I am saying? Right from childhood, which means what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t want to enter into this dangerous field yet!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What is it? Perhaps you want to leave that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is some factor that is missing. I want to capture it. You see, if that is an exception, then it is silly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All right. Then we agree that the thing is dormant in all human beings; is that what you want to say?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not quite sure that is what I want to say.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I meant that the factor is there in all mankind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is a dangerous statement too.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is what you were saying.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know, but I am questioning. When I am quite sure, I will tell you.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All right. We tried this, and we can say it seems promising but it is a bit dangerous. This possibility is there in all mankind, and in so far as some people have seen it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means God is in you?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, it is just that the possibility of insight is there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, partly. I am questioning all this. The father responds to hate by hate; the son doesn’t.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That happens from time to time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, consistently from the beginning - why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It must depend on insight, which shows the futility of hate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why did that man have it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, why?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And why if this seems so terribly natural to him, is it not natural to everybody? As water is natural to everybody.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, why isn’t insight present for everybody from the beginning?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is what I am asking.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So strongly that even maltreatment cannot affect it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Nothing can affect it, that is my point. Maltreatment, beating, being put into all kinds of dreadful situations hasn’t affected it. Why? We are coming to something.</p>

<h1>7. Death Has Very Little Meaning</h1>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are we saying that human beings are still behaving with the animal instincts?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>Yes, and that the animal instincts, it seems, may be overpowering in their intensity and speed, and especially with young children. It may be that it is only natural for them to respond with the animal instinct.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So that means, after a million years, that we are still instinctively behaving like our ancestors?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In some ways. Probably our behaviour is also complicated by thought; the animal instinct has now become entangled with thought, and it is getting in some ways worse.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Far worse.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because all these instincts of hatred now become directed and sustained by thought, so that they are more subtle and dangerous.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And during all these many centuries we haven’t found a way, a method, a system - something that will move us away from that track. Is that it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. One of the difficulties, surely, is that when people begin to be angry with each other, their anger builds up and they can’t seem to do anything about it. They may try to control it, but that doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As we were saying, someone - ‘X’ - behaves naturally in a way that is not a response to the animal instinct. What place has this kind of insight in human society? None at all?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In society as it is, it cannot be accommodated, because society is organized under the assumption that pain and pleasure are going to rule. You could say that friendliness is a kind of animal instinct too, for people become friendly for instinctive reasons. And perhaps they become enemies for similar reasons.</p>
<p>So I think that some people would say that we should be rational rather than instinctive. There was a period during the 18th century, the Age of Reason, when they said man could be rational, could choose to be rational, in order to bring about harmony everywhere.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But he hasn’t done so!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, things got worse, leading to the French Revolution, to the Terror and so on. But, after that, people didn’t have so much faith in reason as a way of getting anywhere, or coming out of conflict.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So where does that lead us? We were talking really about insight that actually changes the nature of the brain itself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, by dispelling the darkness in the brain, insight allows the brain to function in a new way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Thought has been operating in darkness, creating its own darkness and functioning in that. And insight is, as we said, like a flash which breaks down the darkness. Then when that insight clears the darkness, does man act, or function, rationally?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, man will then function rationally, and with perception, rather than by rules and reason. But there is a freely flowing reason. You see, some people identify reason with certain rules of logic which would be mechanical. But there can be reason as a form of perception of order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So we are saying, are we, that insight is perception?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is the flash of light which makes perception possible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Right, that’s it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is even more fundamental than perception.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So insight is pure perception, and from that perception there is action, which is then sustained by rationality. Is that it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And the rationality is perception of order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, would you say, there is insight, perception and order?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But that order is not mechanical because it is not based on logic.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There are no rules.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No rules; let’s put it that way; it’s better. This order is not based on rules. This means insight, perception, action, order. Then you come to the question, is insight continuous, or is it by flashes?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We went into that, and felt it was a wrong question, so perhaps we can look at it differently. It is not time-binding.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not time-binding. Yes, we agreed on that. So now let’s get a little further. We said, didn’t we, that insight is the elimination of the darkness which is the very centre of the self, the darkness that self creates? Insight dispels that very centre.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. With the darkness, perception is not possible. It’s blindness in a way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Right, then what next? I am an ordinary man, with all my animal instincts, pleasure and pain and reward and punishment and so on. I hear you say this, and I see what you are saying has some kind of reason, logic and order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it makes sense as far as we can see it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It makes sense. Then how am I to have reason in my life? How am I to bring it about? You understand that these words which are difficult, are all of them time-binding. But is that possible?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, without time, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it possible for man with his narrow mind, to have this insight, so that pattern of life is broken? As we said the other day, we have tried all this, tried every form of self-denial, and yet that insight doesn’t come about.</p>
<p>Once in a while there is a partial insight, but that partial insight is not the whole insight, so there is still partial darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which doesn’t dispel the centre of the self. It may dispel some darkness in a certain area, but the source of the darkness, the creator, the sustainer of it, is still there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Still there. Now what shall we do? But this is a wrong question. This leads nowhere.</p>
<p>We have stated the general plan, right? And I have to make the moves, or make no moves at all. I haven’t the energy. I haven’t the capacity to see it quickly. Because this is immediate, not just something that I practise and eventually get. I haven’t the capacity, I haven’t the sense of urgency, of immediacy. Everything is against me: my family, my wife, society. Everything! And does this mean that I eventually have to become a monk?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No. Becoming a monk is the same as becoming anything else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. Becoming a monk is like becoming a businessman! I see all this, verbally as well as rationally, intellectually, but I can’t capture this thing. Is there a different approach to this problem? I am always asking the same question, because I am caught in the same pattern. So, is there a totally different way? A totally different approach to the whole turmoil of life? Is there a different manner of looking at it? Or is the old way the only way?</p>
<p>We have said that as long as the centre is creating darkness, and thought is operating in that darkness, there must be disorder, and society will be as it is now. To move away from that, you must have insight. Insight can only come about when there is a flash, a sudden light, which abolishes not only darkness but the creator of darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now I am asking if there is a different approach to this question altogether, although an old response seems so absolute.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well possibly. When you say it seems absolute, do you want a less absolute approach?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am saying that if that is the only way, then we are doomed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You can’t produce this flash at will.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it can’t be produced through will, through sacrifice, through any form of human effort. That is out; we know we have finished with all that. And also we agreed that to some people - to ‘X’ - this insight seemed so natural and we asked why is it not natural to others?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If we begin with the child, it seems natural to the child to respond with his animal instincts, with great intensity which sweeps him away. Darkness arises because it is so overwhelming.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but why is it different with ‘X’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>First of all it seems natural to most people that the animal instincts would take over.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And they would say the other fellow, ‘X’, is unnatural.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So that is the way mankind has been thinking, saying that if there are indeed any people who are different they must be very unusual and unnatural.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. Human beings have been responding to hatred by hatred, and so on. There are those few, perhaps many, who say that is not natural or rational. Why has this division taken place?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If we say that pleasure and pain, fear and hate, are natural, then it is felt that we must battle to control these, otherwise they will destroy us. The best we can hope for is to control them with reason, or through another way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But that doesn’t work! Are people like ‘X’, who function differently, the privileged few, by some miracle, by some strange chance event?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Many people would say that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it goes against one’s grain. I would not accept that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, if that is not the case, then you have to say why there is this difference.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am trying to get at, because ‘X’ is born of the same parents.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, fundamentally the same, so why does he behave differently?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>This question has been asked many times, over and over again in different parts of the world. Now why is there this division?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Is the division really total? You see, even the man who responds to hatred with hatred, nevertheless sees that it doesn’t make sense, is not natural and should be different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It should be different, but he is still battling with ideas. He is trying to get out of it by the exercise of thought which breeds darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>I just want to say that the division does not seem to be so entire.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, but the division is entire, complete.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Well, then, why are people not simply saying, let’s continue to live that way, and let’s enjoy it to the last moment?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because they can’t see anything except their own darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But they want to get out of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now wait a minute. Do they want to get out of it? Do they actually realize the state they are in, and deliberately want to get out of it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>They are ambivalent about it. They want to go on getting the fruits of it, but they have a sense that it is wrong, and that it leads to suffering.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Or else they find they can’t help it. You see, when the time comes to experience anger or pleasure, they can’t get away.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They can’t help it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But they want to get out of it, although they are helpless. There are forces which are stronger than their will.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what shall we do? Or is this division false?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s the point. We had better talk of a difference between these two approaches. This difference is not fundamental.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t think they have anything in common.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why? You say the difference is false, although fundamentally people are the same, but a difference has developed between them. Perhaps most people have taken a wrong turning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, let’s put it that way.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But the difference is not intrinsic, it is not structural, built in like the difference between a tree and a rock.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Agreed. As you say, there is a difference between a rock and a tree, but it is not like that. Let’s be simple. There are two responses. They start from the source; one has taken one direction, and the other has taken a different direction. But the source is the same. Why haven’t all of them moved in the right direction?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We haven’t managed to answer that. I was just saying that if one understands that, then going back to the source, one does not have to take the wrong turn. In a sense we are continually taking this wrong turn, so if we can understand this, then it becomes possible to change. And we are continually starting from the same source, not going back in time to a source.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Just a minute, just a minute.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There are two possible ways of taking our statement. One is to say that the source is in time, that far back in the past we started together and took different paths. The other is to say that the source is timeless, and we are continually taking the wrong turn, again and again. Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, it is constantly the wrong turn. Why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>This means that there is the constant possibility of the right turn.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, of course. That’s it. If we say there is a source from which we all began, then we are caught in time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We can’t go back.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, that is out. Therefore it is apparent that we are taking the wrong turn all the time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Constantly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Constantly taking the wrong turn. But why? The one who is living with insight and the other who is not living with insight - are these constant? The man who is living in darkness can move away at any time to the other. That is the point. At any time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then nothing holds him, except constantly taking the wrong turn. You could say the darkness is such that he doesn’t see himself taking the wrong turn.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are we pursuing the right direction, putting the right question? Suppose you have that insight, and your darkness, the very centre of darkness, has been dispelled completely. And I, a serious, fairly intelligent human being, listen to you. And whatever you have said seems reasonable, rational, sane. I question the division. The division is created by the centre which creates darkness. Thought has created it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, in darkness, thought creates the division.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>From the darkness a shadow is thrown; it makes a division.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If we have that insight, we say there is no division.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And man won’t accept that, because in his darkness there is nothing but division. So we, living in darkness, have created the division. We have created it in our thoughts...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We are constantly creating it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, always wanting to live constantly in a state in which there is no division. That movement, however, is still the movement of darkness. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How am I to dispel this continuous, constant darkness? That is the only question, because, as long as that exists, I create this constant division. You see, this is going round in circles. I can only dispel the darkness through insight, and I cannot have that insight by any effort of will, so I am left with nothing. So what is my problem? My problem is to perceive the darkness, to perceive the thought that is creating darkness, and to see that the self is the source of this darkness. Why can’t I see that? Why can’t I see it even logically?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it’s clear logically.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but somehow it doesn’t seem to operate. So what shall I do? I realize for the first time that the self is creating the darkness which is constantly breeding division. I see that very clearly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And the division produces the darkness anyway.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Vice versa, back and forth. And from all that, everything begins. I see that very clearly. What shall I do? So I don’t admit division.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Krishnaji, aren’t we introducing division again, nevertheless, when we say there is the man who needs insight?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But man has insight. ‘X’ has insight, and he has explained very clearly how darkness has vanished. I listen to him, and he says your very darkness is creating the division. Actually, there is no division, no division as light and darkness. So he asks me, can you banish, can you put away this sense of division?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You seem to be bringing back a division by saying that, by saying that I should do it, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, not ‘should’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In a way you are saying that the thought process of the mind seems spontaneously to produce division. You say, try to put it aside, and at the same time it is trying to make division.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand. But can my mind put away division? Or is that a wrong question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Can it put away division as long as it is divided?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it can’t. So what am I to do?</p>
<p>Listen. ‘X’ says something so extraordinarily true, of such immense significance and beauty that my whole being says ‘Capture it’. That is not a division.</p>
<p>I recognize that I am the creator of division, because I am living in darkness, and so out of that darkness I create. But I have listened to ‘X’, who says there is no division. And I recognize that is an extraordinary statement. So the very saying of that to one who has lived in constant division has an immediate effect. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that one has to, as you say, put away the division...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I will leave that; I won’t put it away. That statement that there is no division - I want to get at that a little bit. I am getting somewhere with it.</p>
<p>‘X’s’ statement from this insight, that there is no division, has a tremendous effect on me. I have lived constantly in division, and he comes along and says there is no division. What effect has it on me?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then you say there is no division. That makes sense. But on the other hand it seems that the division exists.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I recognize the division, but the statement that there is no division has this immense impact on me. That seems natural, doesn’t it? When I see something that is immovable, it must have some effect on me. I respond to it with a tremendous shock.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, if you were talking about something which was in front of us, and you said, ‘No, it is not that way’, then that would, of course, change your whole way of seeing it. Now you say this division is not that way. We try to look and see if that is so - right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t even say, ‘Is that so?’ ‘X’ has very carefully explained the whole business, and he says at the end of it that there is no division. And I am sensitive, watching very carefully, and realizing that I am constantly living in division. When ‘X’ makes that statement it has broken the pattern.</p>
<p>I don’t know if you follow what I am trying to explain? It has broken the pattern, because he has said something which is so fundamentally true. There is no God and man. Right, Sir, I stick to that. I see something - which is, where hatred exists the other is not. But, hating, I want the other. So constant division is born out of darkness. And the darkness is constant. But I have been listening very carefully, and ‘X’ makes a statement which seems absolutely true. That enters into me, and the act of his statement dispels the darkness. I am not making an effort to get rid of darkness, but ‘X’ is the light. That’s right, I hold to that.</p>
<p>So it comes to something, which is, can I listen with my darkness - in my darkness, which is constant? In that darkness, can I listen to you? Of course I can. I am living in constant division which brings darkness. ‘X’ comes along and tells me there is no division.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right. Now why do you say you can listen in the darkness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes, I can listen in darkness. If I can’t I am doomed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But that is no argument.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course that is no argument, but it is so!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Living in darkness is not worthwhile. But now we say that it is possible to listen in the darkness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He, ‘X’, explains to me very, very carefully. I am sensitive, I have been listening to him in my darkness, but that is making me sensitive, alive, watching. That is what I have been doing. We have been doing it together. And he makes a statement that there is absolutely no division. And I know that I am living in division. That very statement has brought the constant movement to an end.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if this doesn’t take place I have nothing - you follow? I am perpetually living in darkness. But there is a voice in the wilderness, and listening to that voice has an extraordinary effect.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Listening reaches the source of the movement, whereas observation does not.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I have observed, I have listened, I have played all kinds of games all my life. And I now see, that there is only one thing. That there is this constant darkness and I am acting in the darkness; in this wilderness which is darkness; whose centre is the self. I see that absolutely, completely; I can’t argue against it any more. And ‘X’ comes along and tells me this. In that wilderness a voice says there is water. You follow? It is not hope. There is immediate action in me.</p>
<p>One must realize, that this constant movement in darkness is my life. You follow what I am saying? Can I, with all the experience, with all the knowledge which I have gathered over a million years, suddenly realize that I am living in total darkness? Because that means I have reached the end of all hope. Right? But my hope is also darkness. The future is out altogether, so I am left with this enormous darkness, and I am there. That means, the realization of that is the ending of becoming. I have reached that point and ‘X’ tells me this is natural.</p>
<p>You see, all the religions have said this division exists.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But, they say it can be overcome.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is the same pattern repeated. It doesn’t matter who said it, but the fact is somebody in this wilderness is saying something, and in that wilderness I have been listening to every voice, and to my own voice, which has created more and more darkness. Yet, this is right. That means, doesn’t it, that when there is insight there is no division?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is not your insight or my insight, it is insight. In that there is no division.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which brings us to that ground we spoke of...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What about the ground?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In that ground there is no darkness as darkness, or light as light. In that ground, there is no division. Nothing is born of will, or time, or thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that light and darkness are not divided?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which means to say there is neither.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Neither, that’s it! There is something else. There is a perception that there is a different movement, which is ‘non-dualistic’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Non-dualistic means what? No division.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No division. I won’t use ‘non-dualistic’. There is no division.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But nevertheless there is movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What does that mean now, without division?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I mean by movement, that movement which is not time. That movement doesn’t breed division. So I want to go back, lead to the ground. If, in that ground, there is neither darkness nor light, no God or the son of God - there is no division - what takes place? Would you say that the ground is movement?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it could be, yes. Movement is undivided.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. I say there is movement in darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but we said there is no division of darkness and light, and yet you said there is movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Would you say the ground is endless movement?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What does that mean?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it is difficult to express.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Keep on going into it; let’s express it. What is movement, apart from movement from here to there, apart from time - is there any other movement?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is. The movement from being to becoming, psychologically. There is the movement of distance, there is the movement of time. We say those are all divisions. Is there a movement which in itself has no division? When you have made that statement that there is no division, there is that movement surely?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, are you saying that when there is no division that movement is there?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, and I said, ‘X’ says that is the ground.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would you say it has no end, no beginning?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means again time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Can one say that movement has no form?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No form - all that. I want to go a little further. What I am asking is, we said that when you have stated there is no division, this means no division in movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It flows without division, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, it is a movement in which there is no division. Do I capture the significance of that? Do I understand the depth of that statement? A movement in which there is no division, which means no time, no distance as we know it. No element of time in it at all. So I am trying to see if that movement is surrounding man.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, enveloping.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want to get at this. I am concerned with mankind, humanity, which is me. ‘X’ has made several statements, and I have captured a statement which seems so absolutely true - that there is no division. Which means that there is no action which is divisive.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I see that. And I also ask, is that movement without time, etc.? It seems that it is the world, you follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The universe.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The universe, the cosmos, the whole.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The totality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Totality. Isn’t there a statement in the Jewish world, ‘Only God can say I am’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that’s the way the language is built. It is not necessary to state it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I understand. You follow what I am trying to get at?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that only this movement is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can the mind be of that movement? Because that is timeless, therefore deathless.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the movement is without death; in so far as the mind takes part in that, it is the same.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You understand what I am saying?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. But what dies when the individual dies?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That has no meaning, because once I have understood there is no division...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...then it is not important.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Death has no meaning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It still has a meaning in some other context.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, the ending of the body; that’s totally trivial. But you understand? I want to capture the significance of the statement that there is no division, it has broken the spell of my darkness, and I see that there is a movement, and that’s all. Which means death has very little meaning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You have abolished totally the fear of death.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I understand that when the mind is partaking in that movement, then the mind is that movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s all! The mind is that movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Would you say that matter is also that movement?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I would say everything is. In my darkness I have listened to ‘X’. That’s most important. And his clarity has broken my spell. When he said there is no division, he abolished the division between life and death. I don’t know if you see this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>One can never say then, ‘I am immortal’. It is so childish.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that’s the division.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or, ‘I am seeking immortality’. Or, ‘I am becoming’. We have wiped away the whole sense of moving in darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>What then would be the significance of the world? Is there a significance to it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The world?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>With man.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Society, do you mean?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Yes, it seems that when you make that statement, there is no division, and life is death - what then is the significance of man with all his struggle...?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Man in darkness. What importance has that? It is like struggling in a locked room. That is the whole point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Significance can only rise when the darkness is dispelled.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>The only significance is the dispelling of the darkness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no, no!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Aren’t we going to say that something more can be done besides dispelling the darkness?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I have listened very carefully to everything that you, who have insight, say. What you have done is to dispel the centre. In darkness I could invent many things of significance; that there is light, there is God, there is beauty, there is this and that. But it is still in the area of darkness. Caught in a room full of darkness, I can invent a lot of pictures, but I want to get something else. Is the mind the one who has this insight - who therefore dispels darkness and has understanding of the ground which is movement without time - is that mind itself the movement?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but it isn’t the totality. The mind is the movement, but we are saying movement is matter, movement is mind. And we were saying that the ground may be beyond the universal mind. You said earlier that the movement, that the ground, is more than the universal mind, more than the emptiness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We said that; much more.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Much more. But we have to get this clear. We say that the mind is this movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, mind is the movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We are not saying that this movement is only mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no, no.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is the point I was trying to get correct.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Mind is the movement - mind, in the sense, ‘the ground’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you said that the ground goes beyond the mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now just a minute: what do you mean by ‘beyond the mind’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Just going back to what we were discussing a few days ago: we said we have the emptiness, the universal mind, and then the ground is beyond that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would you say beyond that is this movement?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. The mind emerges from the movement as a ground, and falls back to the ground; that is what we are saying.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s right. Mind emerges from the movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And it dies back into the movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. It has its being in the movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and matter also.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. So, what I want to get at is, I am a human being faced with this ending and beginning. And ‘X’ abolishes that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it is not fundamental.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is not fundamental. One of the greatest fears of life, which is death, has been removed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see what it does to a human being when there is no death? It means the mind doesn’t age - the ordinary mind I am talking about. I don’t know if I am conveying this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s go slowly. You say the mind does not age, but what if the brain cells age?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I question it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But how can we know that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because there is no conflict, because there is no strain, there is no becoming, no movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This is something that it is hard to communicate with certainty about.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. You can’t prove any of this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But the other, what we have said so far...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...can be reasoned.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is reason, and also you can feel it. But now you are stating something about the brain cells that I have no feeling for. It might be so; it could be so.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think it is so. I won’t discuss it. When a mind has lived in the darkness and is in constant movement there is the wearing out, the darkness and is in constant movement there is the wearing out, the decay of the cells.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We could say that this conflict will cause cells to decay. But somebody might argue that perhaps even without conflict they could decay at a slower rate. Let’s say if you were to live hundreds of years, for example, in time the cells would decay no matter what you did.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Go into this slowly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I can readily accept that the rate of decay of the cells could be cut down when we get rid of conflict.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Decay can be slowed down.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps a great deal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A great deal. Ninety per cent.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That we could understand. But if you say a hundred per cent, then it is hard to understand.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ninety per cent. Wait a minute. It can be very, very greatly slowed down. And that means what? What happens to a mind that has no conflict? What is that mind, what is the quality of that mind which has no problem? You see, suppose such a mind lives in pure unpolluted air, having the right kind of food and so on, why can’t it live two hundred years?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well it is possible; some people have lived for a hundred and fifty years, living in very pure air, and eating good food.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But you see, if those very people who have lived a hundred and fifty years, had no conflict, they might live very much longer.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They might. There was a case I was reading of a man in England who lived to be a hundred and fifty. And the doctors became interested in him. They wined and dined him, and then he died in a few days!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Poor devil!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Krishnaji, you generally say that anything that lives in time, also dies in time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but the brain, which has had insight, has changed the cells.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Are you implying that even the organic brain does not live in time any more?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, don’t bring in time yet. We are saying that insight brings about a change in the brain cells. Which means that the brain cells are no longer thinking in terms of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Psychological time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of, course, that is understood.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If they are not so disturbed, they will remain in order and perhaps they will break down more slowly. We might increase the age limit from one hundred and fifty to two hundred years, provided one also had healthy living at all levels.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but all that sounds so very trivial.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it doesn’t seem to make much difference, although it is an interesting idea.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What if I live another hundred years? We are trying to find out what effect this extraordinary movement has on the brain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. If we say the brain is in some way directly enveloped in this movement; that would bring it to order. But there is a real direct flow, physically.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not only physically.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But also mentally.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, both. It must have an extraordinary effect on the brain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>You talked earlier about energy. Not the everyday energy...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We said that that movement is total energy. Now this insight has captured, seen, that extraordinary movement, and it is part of that energy. I want to come much closer to earth; I have lived with the fear of death, fear of not becoming, and so on. Suddenly I see there is no division, and I understand the whole thing. So what has happened to my brain - you follow?</p>
<p>Let’s see something. See this whole thing, not verbally, but as a tremendous reality, as truth. With all your heart, mind, you see this thing. That very perception must affect your brain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. It brings order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not only order in life but in the brain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>People can prove that if you are under stress the brain cells start to break down. And if you have order in the brain cells, then it is quite different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I have a feeling, Sir - don’t laugh at it; it may be false, it may be true - I feel that the brain never loses the quality of that movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Once it has it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. I am talking of the person who has been through all this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So probably the brain never loses that quality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Therefore it is no longer involved in time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It would no longer be dominated by time. The brain, from what we were saying, is not evolving in any sense, it is just a confusion. You can’t say that man’s brain has evolved during the last ten thousand years. You see science, knowledge, has evolved, but people felt the same about life several thousand years ago as they do now.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want to find out: in that silent emptiness that we went through, is the brain absolutely still? In the sense, no movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not absolutely. You see, the blood is going in the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are not talking of that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What kind of movement are we discussing?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am talking of the movement of thought, the movement of any reaction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. There is no movement in which the brain moves independently. You were saying that there is the movement of the whole, but the brain does not go off on its own, as thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, you have abolished death, which is a tremendously significant thing. And so I say, what is the brain, the mind, when there is no death. You follow? It has undergone a surgical operation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We said the brain normally has the notion of death continually there in the background, and that notion is constantly disturbing the brain, because the brain foresees death, and it is trying to stop it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To stop the ending of itself, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It foresees all that, and thinks it must stop it, but it can’t.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It can’t.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And therefore it has a problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A constant struggle with it. So all that has come to an end. What an extraordinary thing has taken place! How does it affect my daily life, because I have to live on this earth? My daily life is aggression, this everlasting becoming, striving for success - all that has gone. We will pursue this but we have understood a great deal today.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In bringing in the question of daily life you might bring in the question of compassion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Is that movement compassion?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It would be beyond.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. That’s why one must be awfully careful.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then again, compassion might emerge out of it.</p>

<h1>8. Can Insight be Awakened in Another?</h1>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We were discussing what it is for the brain to have no movement. When a human being has been pursuing the path of becoming, and has gone through all that, and this sense of emptiness, silence and energy, he has abandoned almost everything and come to the point, the ground. So how does this insight affect his daily life? What is his relationship to society? What is his action with regard to war, and the whole world - a world that is really living and struggling in darkness? What is his action? I would say, as we agreed the other day, that it is non-movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>Yes, we said before that the ground was movement without division.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Without division. Yes, quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In some sense it seems inconsistent to say non-movement, while you say the ground is movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, the ground is movement. Would you say an average, educated, sophisticated man, with all his unpleasant activities, is constantly in movement?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, a certain kind of movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A movement in time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A movement in becoming. But we are discussing the man who has trodden that path (if I may use that word), and come to that point. From there, what is his action? We said, for the moment, non-action, non-movement. What does that mean?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It means, as you said, not taking part in this process of becoming.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, that is obvious. If he doesn’t take part in this process, what part does he play? Is it one of complete non-action?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not clear why you should call it non-action. We might think that it was action of another kind, which is not part of the process of becoming.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is not becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it may still be action.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He still has to live in the world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In one sense, whatever you do is action, but his action is not directed towards the illusory process, it is not involved in it, but would be directed towards what underlies this illusory process. It would be directed perhaps towards considering the wrong turning which is continually coming out of the ground. Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, yes. You see, various religions have described a man who has been saved, who is illuminated, who has achieved something or other. They have described very clearly, especially in Hindu religious books, how he walks, how he looks, how he talks, the whole state of his being. I think that is merely a poetic description which...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You think it is imagination?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think a great deal of it is imagination. I have discussed this point with some, and it is not like that, not imagination. Somebody who describes it, knows exactly what it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, how should he know? It is not clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what is a man of that kind? How does he live in this world? This is a very interesting question, if you go into it deeply. There is a state of non-movement. That is, the non-movement which we have gone into.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, it is not clear exactly what you mean by non-movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>One becomes poetic but I am trying to avoid that! Although it would be right, even poetically: it is like a single tree in a field. There is no other tree, but that tree, whatever the name of that tree is, it is there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But why do you say, ‘non-movement’?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is non-moving.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The tree stands of course.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A tree is a living, moving thing. I don’t mean that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The tree in a sense is moving, but in relation to the field it stands. That is the picture we get.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, someone comes to you, because you have gone from the beginning to the end. And now you are at the end with a totally different kind of movement, which is timeless, and all that. You are in that. I come to you and ask, ‘What is that state of mind? What is the state of your mind, that has walked on that path and ended something, that has totally moved out of darkness?’</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If you say it is non-movement, are you implying that it is constant?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It must be... But what do you mean by constant? Continuous?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, no.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Do you mean that it is...?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>...static?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>To stand firm, to stand together as a whole. That is really its literal meaning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is the picture you have got of the tree as well. That is the picture which the tree in the field suggests.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I know. That is too romantic and poetic, and it becomes rather deceptive. It is a nice image, but let’s move from it. What is that mind? The quality of that mind that has started from the beginning, and pursued the becoming, and gone through all that centre of darkness which has been wiped away? That mind must be entirely different. Now what does such a mind do, or not do, in the world which is in darkness?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Surely the mind does not do a thing; it does not enter into the movement of that world.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Agreed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And in a sense we say that it is constant - not fixed, but it does not move.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it static?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, it’s not static. It is constant - which in a sense is also movement. There is a constancy which is not merely static, which is also, at the same time, movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We said that movement was not the becoming movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but the ground movement which is completely free.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What has happened to that mind? Let’s go into it a little bit. It has no anxiety and no fear. You see the words ‘compassion’ and ‘love’ are beyond that. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But they may emerge out of this ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The mind being nothing, not a thing, and therefore empty of knowledge, would it always be acting in the light of insight?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It would be pervaded, if not always, by the quality of insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is what I mean.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well ‘always’ brings in time, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Remove the word.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I would use ‘constantly’.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, constantly; let’s use the word ‘constant’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is a bit better, but not good enough.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Let’s use that word. It is acting constantly in that light, in that flash of insight. I think that is right. So what does that mean in one’s daily life? How does one earn a livelihood?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That, surely, would be another point. You would have to find a way to stay alive.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Stay alive. So that is why I am saying this: as civilization grows, begging is not allowed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Is criminal. You have to find some way to stay alive.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what will he do? He has no profession, no special skill, no coin with which he can buy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, wouldn’t it be possible for this mind to earn enough to get what is needed to stay alive?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Why has he no skill to earn a livelihood?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why should he have skill? Why must one have skill to earn a livelihood? You say that, and another man says, ‘Why should I have skill of any kind?’ I am just discussing, enquiring into this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Suppose you had to take care of yourself, you would need a certain skill. If you were by yourself in a cave, you know...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, I don’t want a cave!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I know. But, whoever it is, he has to live somewhere; he needs some skill to find the food which he needs. You see, if everybody were to say no skill is needed then the human race would perish.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not sure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, what would happen then?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am coming to. Skill implies, as we said, knowledge; from knowledge, comes experience, and gradually one develops a skill. And that skill gives one an opportunity to earn a livelihood, either meagre or rich. But this man says, there may be a different way of living and earning. We are used to a pattern, and he says, ‘Look, that may be totally wrong’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It depends what you mean by skill. For example, suppose he has to drive a car, surely that takes some skill?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Is he going to do without that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I had better go carefully into the word ‘skill’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. I mean skill could have a bad meaning - like being very clever at getting money.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So this man is not avaricious, he is not money-minded, he is not storing up for the future, he hasn’t any insurance. But he has to live. When we use the word ‘skill’ to mean driving a car...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...or being a carpenter... If all those skills were to vanish, life would be impossible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The whole thing would collapse.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not sure. Do we mean that kind of skill must be denied?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It couldn’t mean that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. That would be too silly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But then people become very skilful at getting other people to give them money, you see!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Is it that now we have made a division between living and skill, skill and working, living and earning a livelihood?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it! I need to have food, I need to have clothes, and shelter.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But is the division necessary? As society is built now, we have a division between living and working.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have been through all that. We are talking of a man who has been through all this, and has come back to the world, and says, ‘Here I am’. What is his relationship to society, and what is he to do? Has he any relationship to society?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, not in a deep or fundamental sense, although there is a superficial relationship that he has to have.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. A superficial contact with the world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>He has to obey the laws, he has to follow the traffic signals.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. But I want to find out, what is he to do? Write? Talk? That means skill.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Surely that kind of skill need not be harmful?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am just asking.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Like the other skills; like carpentry.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That kind of skill. But what is he to do? I think if we could find out the quality of a mind that has been through all that from the beginning to the end, all that we have talked of in our recent discussions; that man’s mind is entirely different, yet he is in the world. How does he look upon it? You have reached and come back - these are approximate terms - and I am an ordinary man, living in this world. So what is your relationship to me? Obviously none, because I am living in a world of darkness and you are not. So your relationship can only exist when I come out of it - when darkness ends.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then there is only that; there is not a relationship. But now there is division between you and me. And I look at you with my eyes, which are accustomed to darkness and to division. But you are not. And yet you have to have some contact with me. You have to have, however superficial, however slight, a certain relationship with me. Is that relationship compassion, and not something translated by me as compassion? From my darkness I cannot judge what compassion is. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. That follows from that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t know what your love is, what your compassion is because my only love and compassion has been this. And so, what do I do with you?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Who are we talking about now? It is not clear to me whom we are discussing!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You or ‘X’, have been through all that, and come back.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then why hasn’t ‘Y’ done so?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>‘Y’ has not. ‘Y’ asks, ‘Who are you? You seem so different. Your way of looking at life is different.’ And what will ‘Y’ do with ‘X’? That is the question. Not what will ‘X’ do to ‘Y’. I don’t know if I am making it clear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I understand. What will ‘Y’ do with ‘X’?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Our question until now has been what will ‘X’ do with ‘Y’, but I think we were putting the wrong question. What will ‘Y’ do with ‘X’? I think what would happen generally is that ‘Y’ would worship, kill or neglect him. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If ‘Y’ worships ‘X’ then everything is very simple. He has the goodies of the world. But that doesn’t answer my question. My question is not only what will ‘Y’ do to ‘X’, but what will ‘X’ do with ‘Y’? ‘X’s’ demand is, ‘Look, walk out of this darkness; there is no answer in the darkness, so walk out.’ It doesn’t matter, whatever phrase we use - walk out, dispel it, get rid of it, etc. And ‘Y’ then says, ‘Help me, show me the way’, and is back again in darkness - you follow? So what will ‘Y’ do to ‘X’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I can’t see that ‘Y’ can do very much, except what you mentioned - to worship, or to do something else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To kill or neglect ‘X’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But if compassion works in ‘X’...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, ‘X’ is that. He won’t even call it compassion.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, but we call it that. Then ‘X’ will work to find a way to penetrate the darkness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait! So ‘X’s’ job is to work on darkness?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>To discover how to penetrate darkness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In that way he is earning a living.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, possibly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. I am talking seriously.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It depends on whether people are willing to pay him for it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No joking. Seriously.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is possible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Probably ‘X’ is the teacher. ‘X’ is out of society. ‘X’ is unrelated to this field of darkness and saying to the people who are caught in it, ‘Come out’. What’s wrong with that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Nothing is wrong with that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is his means of livelihood.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It’s perfectly all right as long as it works. Of course, if there were a lot of people like ‘X’, there would have to be some limit.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, Sir. What would happen if there were lots of people like ‘X’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is an interesting question. I think there would be something revolutionary.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The whole thing would change.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. If there were lots of people like that, they would not be divided. That is the whole point, right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that even if ten or fifteen people were undivided they would exert a force that has never been seen in our history.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Tremendous! That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because I don’t think it has ever happened, that ten people have been undivided.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is ‘X’s’ job in life. He says that is the only thing. A group of those ten ‘X’s’ will bring a totally different kind of revolution. Will society stand for that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They will have this extreme intelligence, and so they will find a way to do it, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Society will stand for it, because the ‘X’s’ will be intelligent enough not to provoke society, and society will not react before it is too late.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite right. You are saying something which is actually happening. Would you say then that the function of many ‘X’s’ is to awaken human beings to that intelligence which will dispel the darkness? And that this is ‘X’s’ means of livelihood?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then there are those people who in darkness cultivate this and exploit people, but there are ‘X’s’ who don’t exploit. All right. That seems very simple, but I don’t think it is all that simple.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that the only function of ‘X’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well it is really a difficult function.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But I want to find out something much deeper than mere function.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, function is not enough.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. Apart from function, what is he to do? ‘X’ says to ‘Y’, ‘Listen’; and ‘Y’ takes time, and gradually, perhaps, at some time he will wake up and move away. And is that all ‘X’ is going to do in life?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That can only be an outcome of something deeper.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The deeper is all that; the ground.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But is that all he is to do in this world? Just to teach people to move out of darkness?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that seems to be the prime task at the moment, in the sense that, if this doesn’t happen, the whole society will sooner or later collapse. We could ask whether he needs to be in some sense more deeply creative.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it is not clear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Suppose ‘X’ is you, and you have an enormous field in which to operate, not merely teaching me but having this extraordinary movement which is not of time. That is, you have this abounding energy, and you have produced all that to teach me to come out of darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That can only be a part of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what does the rest do, you follow? I don’t know if I am conveying this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, this is what I tried to suggest by talking of some creative action, beyond this, taking place.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, beyond this. You may write, you may preach, you may heal, you may do this and that, but all those activities are rather trivial. But you have something else. Have I reduced you, ‘X’, to my pettiness? You can’t be so reduced. My pettiness says, ‘You must do something. You must preach, write, heal, do something to help me to move.’ Right? You comply to the very smallest degree, but you have something much more than that, something immense. You understand my question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. So what happens?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How is that immensity operating on ‘Y’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that there is some more direct action?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Either there is more direct action, or ‘X’ is doing something totally different to affect the consciousness of man.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What could this be?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because ‘X’ is not ‘satisfied’ with merely preaching and talking. That immensity which he is must have an effect, must do something.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying ‘must’ in the sense of the feeling of needing to do it, or are you saying ‘must’ in the sense of necessity?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It must.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It must necessarily do so. But how will it affect mankind? You see, when you say this, it would suggest to people that there is some sort of extrasensory effect that spreads.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am trying to capture.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am trying to convey.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not merely through the words, through the activities or gestures.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s leave the activity alone. That is simple. It is not just that, because that immensity must...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...Necessarily act? There is a more direct action?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. All right. That immensity necessarily has other activities.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Other activities at other levels?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, other activities. This has been translated in the Hindu teachings as various degrees of consciousness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There are different levels or degrees of acting.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All that too is a very small affair. What do you say, Sir?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, since the consciousness emerges from the ground, this activity is affecting all mankind from the ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see many people will find this very difficult to understand.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not interested in many people. I want to understand you, ‘X’ and me, ‘Y’. That ground, that immensity, is not limited to such a petty little affair. It couldn’t be.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The ground includes physically the whole universe.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, the whole universe, and to reduce all that to...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...these little activities...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...is all so silly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that raises the question of what is the significance of mankind in the universe, or in the ground?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because even the best of these little things that we have been doing have very little significance on that scale. Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, this is just opening the chapter. I think that ‘X’ is doing something - not doing, but by his very existence...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...he is making something possible?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. When you read of Einstein, he has made something possible, which man hadn’t discovered before.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We can see that fairly easily because it works through the usual channels of society.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I understand that. What is ‘X’ bringing apart from the little things? Putting it into words makes it sound wrong. ‘X’ has that immense intelligence, that energy, that something, and he must operate at a much greater level than one can possibly conceive, which must affect the consciousness of those who are living in darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Possibly so. The question is, will this effect show in any way? You know, manifestly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Apparently not. If you hear the television or radio news, and know what is happening all over the world, apparently it is not doing so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is what is difficult, and a matter of great concern.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it must have an effect. It has to.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why do you say it has to?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because light must affect darkness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>perhaps ‘Y’ might say that, living in darkness, he is not sure that there is such an effect. He might say perhaps there is, but I want to see it manifest. Not seeing anything and still being in darkness, he then asks, what shall I do?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand that. So are you saying that ‘X’s’ only activity is just writing, teaching, etc.?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No. Merely that it may well be that the activity is much greater, but it doesn’t show. If only we could see it!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How would it be shown? How would ‘Y’, who wants proof of it, see it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>‘Y’ might say something like this: many people have made a similar statement, and some of them have obviously been wrong. But one wants to say it could be true. You see, until now, I think the things we have said make sense, and they follow to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I understand all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And now you say something which goes much further. Other people have said things like that and one feels that they were on the wrong track, that they, or at least some of these people, were fooling themselves.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. ‘X’ says, we are being very logical.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but at this stage logic will not carry us any further.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is very reasonable! We have been through all that. So ‘X’s’ mind is not acting in an irrational way.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You could say that, having seen the thing was reasonable, so far, ‘Y’ may have some confidence that it could go further.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is what I am trying to say.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Of course, there is no proof.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So could we explore?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am trying to do.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>What about the other activities of ‘X’? We said he has the function of teaching, but also that ‘X’ has other activities.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He must have. Necessarily must.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But what?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t know; we are trying to find that out.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You are saying that somehow he makes possible an activity of the ground in the whole consciousness of mankind which would not have been possible without him.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>His contact with ‘Y’ is not only verbal. ‘Y’ listens but there is some other quality...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but ‘X’ says all that is a petty little affair. That is, of course, understood, but ‘X’ says there is something much greater.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>The effect of ‘X’ is perhaps far greater than can be put in words.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are trying to find out what that greater is that must necessarily be operating.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Is it something that appears in the daily life of ‘X’?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. In his daily life ‘X’ is apparently doing fairly small things - teaching, writing, book-keeping, or whatever. But is that all? It seems so silly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that in the daily life ‘X’ does not look so different from anybody else?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, apparently not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But there is something else going on which does not show. Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. When ‘X’ talks it may be different, he may say things differently but...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...that is not fundamental, because there are so many people who say things differently from others.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know. But the man who has walked through all that right from the beginning! If such a man has the whole of that energy to call upon, to reduce it all to these petty little things seems ridiculous.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let me ask a question: Why does the ground require this man to operate on mankind? Why can’t the ground, as it were, operate directly on mankind to clear things up?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, just a minute, just a minute. Are you asking why the ground demands action?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why does it require a particular man to affect mankind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, that I can easily explain. It is part of existence, like the stars.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Can the immensity act directly on mankind? Does it have to inform a man to enter the consciousness of mankind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are talking about something else. I want to find out if ‘X’ says, I am not going to be reduced only to writing and talking; that is too small and petty. And the other question is, why does the ground need this man? It doesn’t need him.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But when he is here, the ground will use him.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is so.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, would it be possible that the ground could do something to clear this up?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I want to find out. That is why I am saying, in different words, that the ground doesn’t need the man, but the man has touched the ground.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So the ground is using him, let’s say employing him. He is part of that movement. Is that all? Do you follow what I mean? Am I asking the wrong questions? Why should he do anything? Except this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, perhaps he does nothing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That very doing nothing, may be the doing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Doing nothing makes possible the action of the ground. It may be that. In doing nothing which has any specified aim...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. No specified content which can be translated into human terms.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but still he is supremely active in doing nothing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Is there an action which is beyond time, for that man?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He is that...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Then we cannot ask for a result from that man.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>He is not asking for results.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>But ‘Y’ is asking for a result.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Perhaps ‘X’ says, I am concerned to talk, etc., which is a very small thing. But there is a vast field which must affect the whole of mankind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is an analogy which may not be very good but we can consider it. In chemistry, a catalyst makes possible a certain action without itself taking part, but merely by being what it is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, is that what is happening? Even that is a small affair.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>And even there ‘Y’ would say it isn’t happening, because the world is still in a mess. So is there a truth in the world for the activity of that man?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>‘X’ says he is sorry, but that is no question at all. I am not interested in proving anything. It isn’t a mathematical or a technical problem to be shown and proved. ‘X’ says that he has walked from the beginning of man to the very end of man, and that there is a movement which is timeless. The ground which is the universe, the cosmos, everything. And the ground doesn’t need the man, but the man has come upon it. And he is still a man in the world, who says, ‘I write and do something or other,’ not to prove the ground, not to do anything. ‘X’ does that just out of compassion. But there is a much greater movement which necessarily plays a part in the world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Does the greater movement play a part through ‘X’?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously, ‘X’ says that there is something else operating which cannot possibly be put into words. He asks, ‘What am I to do?’ There is nothing which a man like ‘Y’ will understand. He will immediately translate it into some kind of illusory thing. But ‘X’ says there is something else. Otherwise it is all so childish.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think the general view which people are developing now is that the universe has no meaning, that it moves any old way, things just happen, and none of them has any meaning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>None of them has meaning for the man who is here, but the man who is there, speaking relatively, says it is full of meaning, and not invented by thought.</p>
<p>All right, let’s leave the vastness, and all that. ‘X’ says, perhaps there will be ten people with this insight and that might affect society. It will not be communism, socialism, this or that political reorganization. It will be totally different, and based on intelligence and compassion.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, if there were ten, they might find a way to spread this much more.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s what I am trying to get at.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What do you mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>‘X’ brings the universe, but I translate it into something trivial.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that if the whole of mankind were to see this that would be something different?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes, of course!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Would it be new...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...It would be paradise on earth.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It would be like an organism of a new kind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. But you see, I am not satisfied with this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, what is it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not ‘satisfied’ in leaving this immensity to be reduced to some few words. It seems so stupid, so incredible. You see man, ‘Y’, is concerned with concepts like ‘show me’, ‘prove it to me’, ‘what benefit has it?’, ‘will it affect my future?’ You follow? He is concerned with all that. And he is looking at ‘X’ with eyes that are accustomed to this pettiness! So, he reduces that immensity to his pettiness, and puts it in a temple and has therefore lost it completely. But ‘X’ says, I won’t even look at that; there is something so immense, please do look at it. But ‘Y’ is always translating it by wanting demonstration, proof or reward. He is always concerned with that. ‘X’ brings light. That’s all he can do. Isn’t that enough?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>To bring the light which would allow other people to be open to the immensity?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it like this? We only see a small part, but that very small part extends to infinity?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That small part of what?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. We see immensity only as a very small thing. And that immensity is the whole universe. I can’t help but think that it must have some tremendous effect on ‘Y’; on society.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Certainly the perception of this must have an effect, but it seems that this is not in the consciousness of society at the moment.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you are saying still the effect is there?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Are you saying that the perception of even a small part is the infinity?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Questioner: </span>Is it in itself the changing factor?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Do you think it is possible that a thing like this could divert the course of mankind away from the dangerous path it is taking?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is what I think. But to divert the course of man’s destruction somebody must listen. Right? Somebody - ten people - must listen!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Listen to that immensity calling.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So the immensity may divert the course of man. The individual cannot do it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. The individual cannot do it, obviously. But ‘X’ who is supposed to be an individual, has trodden this path, and says, ‘Listen’. But man does not listen.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, then, is it possible to discover how to make people listen?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, then we are back!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What do you mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don’t act; you have nothing to do.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What does it mean not to do a thing?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I realize, as ‘Y’, that whatever I do - whether I sacrifice, practise, renounce - whatever I do, I am still living in that circle of darkness. So ‘X’ says, ‘Don’t act; you have nothing to do.’ You follow? But that is translated by ‘Y’, who does everything except wait and see what happens. We must pursue this, Sir, otherwise it is all so hopeless from the point of view of ‘Y’.</p>

<h1>9. Senility and the Brain Cells</h1>

<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I would like to talk over with you, and perhaps with Narayan<sup>[<a href="#footnote-1" id="reference-1">1</a>]</sup> too, what is happening to the human brain. We have a civilization that is highly cultivated, and yet at the same time barbarous, with selfishness clothed in all kinds of spiritual garbs. Deep down, however, there is a frightening selfishness. Man’s brain has been evolving through millennia upon millennia, yet it has come to this divisive, destructive point, which we all know. So I am wondering whether the human brain - not a particular brain, but the human brain - is deteriorating? Whether it is just in a slow and steady decline? Or whether it is possible in one’s lifetime to bring about in the brain a total renewal from all this; a renewal that will be pristine, original, unpolluted? I have been wondering about this, and I would like to discuss it.</p>
<p>I think the human brain is not a particular brain; it doesn’t belong to me, or to anyone else. It is the human brain which has evolved over millions of years. And in that evolution it has gathered tremendous experience, knowledge and all the cruelties, vulgarities and brutalities of selfishness. Is there a possibility of its sloughing off all this, and becoming something else? Because apparently it is functioning in patterns. Whether it is a religious pattern, a scientific, a business, or a family pattern, it is always operating, functioning in small narrow circles. Those circles are clashing against each other, and there seems to be no end to this. So what will break down this forming of patterns, so that there is no falling into other new patterns, but breaking down the whole system of patterns, whether pleasant or unpleasant? After all, the brain has had many shocks, challenges and pressures upon it, and if it is not capable of renewing or rejuvenating itself, there is very little hope. You follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>You see, one difficulty might present itself. If you are thinking of the brain structure, we cannot get into the structure, physically.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Physically we cannot. I know, we have discussed this. So what is the brain to do? The brain specialists can look at it, take the dead brain of a human being and examine it, but it doesn’t solve the problem. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what is a human being to do, knowing it cannot be changed from outside? The scientist, the brain specialist and the neurologist explain various things but their explanations, their investigations, are not going to solve this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, there is no evidence that they can.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No evidence.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Some people who do bio-feedback think that they can influence the brain, connecting an instrument to the electrical potentials in the skull and being able to look at them; you can also change your heart beat and blood pressure and other things. These people have raised the hope that something could be done.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But they are not succeeding.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They are not getting very far.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And we can’t wait for these scientists and bio-feedbackers - sorry! - to solve the problem. So what shall we do?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The next question is whether the brain can be aware of its own structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can the brain be aware of its own movement? And can the brain not only be aware of its own movement, but itself have enough energy to break all patterns and move out of them?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You have to ask to what extent the brain is free to break out of patterns?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What do you mean?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, you see, if you begin by saying that the brain is caught in a pattern, it may not be so.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But apparently it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>As far as we can see. It may not be free to break out. It may not have the power.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I have said: not enough energy, not enough power.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it may not be able to take the action needed to get out.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So it has become its own prisoner. Then what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then that is the end.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that the end?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If that is true, then that is the end. If the brain cannot break out then perhaps people would choose to try some other way to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>When we speak of the brain, in one sense it is connected to the senses and the nervous system; the feedback is there. Is there another instrument to which the brain is connected which has a different effect on the brain?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What do you mean by that? Some other factor?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Some other factor in the human system itself. Because, obviously, through the senses the brain does get nourishment, but still that is not enough. Is there some other internal factor which gives energy to the brain?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, I want to discuss this. The brain is constantly occupied with various problems, with holding on, attachment, and so on. It is constantly in a state of preoccupation. That may be the central factor. And, if it is not in occupation, does it go sluggish? If it is not occupied, can it maintain the energy that is required to break down the patterns?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now the first point is that if the brain is not occupied, somebody might think that it would just take things easy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Become lazy and all that! I don’t mean that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If you mean not occupied, but still active...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. I mean that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then we have to go into what is the nature of the activity.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. This brain is so occupied with conflicts, struggles, attachments, fears and pleasures. And this occupation gives to the brain its own energy. If it is not occupied, will it become lazy, drugged, and so lose its elasticity, as it were? Or will that unoccupied state give the brain the required energy to break the patterns?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What makes you say this might happen? We were discussing the other day that when the brain is kept busy with intellectual activity and thought, it does not decay and shrink.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As long as it is thinking, moving, living.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Thinking in a rational way; then it remains strong.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That is what I want to get at too. Which is, as long as it is functioning, moving, thinking rationally...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...it remains strong. If it starts irrational movement, then it breaks down. Also if it gets caught in a routine it begins to die.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. If the brain is caught in any routine - the meditation routine, or the routine of the priests.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Or the daily life of the farmer...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...the farmer, etc., it must gradually become dull.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not only that, but it seems to shrink.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To shrink physically.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps some of the cells die?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To shrink physically, and the opposite to that is the eternal occupation with business - by anyone who does a routine job... thinking, thinking, thinking! And we believe that that also prevents shrinking.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Surely experience seems to show that it does, from measurements that have been made.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, it does. That’s it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The brain starts to shrink at a certain age. Now that is what they have discovered, and just as when the body is not being used the muscles begin to lose their flexibility...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So, take lots of exercise!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, they say exercise the body and exercise the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. If it is caught in any pattern, any routine, any directive, it must shrink.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Could we go into what makes it shrink?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is fairly simple. It is repetition.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Repetition is mechanical, and doesn’t really use the full capacity of the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>One has noticed that people who have spent years and years in meditation are the most dull people on earth. And also with lawyers and professors there is ample evidence of all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>It is suggested that rational thinking postpones senility. But rational thinking itself can sometimes become a pattern.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It might. Rational thinking pursued in a narrow area might become part of the pattern too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But is there some other way?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We will go into that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But let’s clear up things about the body first. You see, if somebody does a lot of exercise for the body, it remains strong, but it can become mechanical.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And therefore it would have a bad effect.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>What about the various traditional religious instruments - yoga, tantra, kundalini, etc.?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know. Oh, they must shrink! Because of what is happening. Take yoga for example. It used not to be vulgarized, if I may use that word. It was kept strictly to the very few, who were not concerned about kundalini and all that, but who were concerned with leading a moral, ethical, so-called spiritual life. You see, I want to get at the root of this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think there is something related to this. It seems that before man was organized into society, he was living close to nature, and it was not possible to live in a routine.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it was not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it was completely insecure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So we are saying that the brain itself becomes extraordinarily alive - is not caught in a pattern - if it lives in a state of uncertainty? Without becoming neurotic!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that is more clear when you say not becoming neurotic - then certainty becomes a form of neurosis. But I would rather say that the brain lives without having certainty, without demanding it, without demanding certain knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So are we saying that knowledge also withers the brain?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, when it is repetitious and becomes mechanical.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But knowledge itself?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we have to be very careful there. I think that knowledge has a tendency to become mechanical. That is, it gets fixed, but we could always be learning, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But learning from a centre, learning as an accumulative process!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Learning with something fixed. You see, we learn something as fixed, and then you learn from there. If we were to be learning without holding anything permanently fixed...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Learning and not adding. Can we do that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I think to a certain extent we have to drop our knowledge. You see, knowledge may be valid up to a point, and then it ceases to be valid. It gets in the way. You could say that our civilization is collapsing because of too much knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We don’t discard what is in the way.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Many forms of knowledge are additive. Unless you know the previous thing, you can’t do the next thing. Would you say that kind of knowledge is repetitive?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No. As long as we are learning. But if we hold some principle, or the centre, fixed, and say it cannot change, then that knowledge becomes mechanical. But, for example, suppose you have to make a living. People must organize society, and so on, and they need knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But there we add more and more.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s right. We may also get rid of some.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Some gets in the way, you see. It is continually moving there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but I am asking, apart from that, about knowledge itself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Do you mean knowledge without this content?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes; the knowing mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which merely wants knowledge, is that what you are saying? Knowledge for its own sake?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I want to question the whole idea of having knowledge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But, again, it is not too clear, because we accept that we need some knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, at a certain level.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So it is not clear what kind of knowledge it is that you are questioning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am questioning the experience that leaves knowledge, that leaves a mark.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but what kind of mark? A psychological mark?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Psychological, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You are questioning this, rather than knowledge of technique and matter, and so on. But you see, when you use the word knowledge by itself, it tends to include the whole.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have said that knowledge at a certain level is essential; there you can add and take away and keep on changing. But I am questioning whether psychological knowledge is not in itself a factor of the shrinking of the brain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What do you mean by psychological knowledge? Knowledge about the mind, knowledge about myself?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Knowledge about myself, and living in that knowledge, and accumulating that knowledge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So if you keep on accumulating knowledge about yourself or about relationships...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...yes, about relationships. That’s it. Would you say such knowledge helps the brain, or makes the brain somewhat inactive, makes it shrink?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Brings it into a rut.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But one should see what it is about this knowledge that makes trouble.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is this knowledge that makes so much trouble? In relationship, that knowledge creates trouble.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it gets in the way because it fixes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If I have an image about someone, that knowledge is obviously going to impede our relationship. It becomes a pattern.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the knowledge about myself and about him and how we are related, makes a pattern.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And therefore that becomes a routine and so it loses its energy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and it occurred to me that routine in that area is more dangerous than routine in, say, the area of daily work.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And if routine in ordinary work can shrink the brain, then in that area it might do some worse thing, because it has a bigger effect.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can the brain, in psychological matters, be entirely free from this kind of knowledge? Look! I am a businessman, and get into the car, bus, taxi or tube train, and I am thinking about what I am going to do, whom I am going to meet in connection with business. My mind is all the time living in that area. Then I come home; there is my wife and children; sex and all that. That also becomes a psychological knowledge from which I am acting. So there is the knowledge of my business, and also the knowledge with regard to my wife and my reactions in relationship. These two are in contradiction, unless I am unaware of them, and just carry on. If I am aware of these two, it becomes a disturbing factor.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Also people find that this is a routine. They get bored with it, and they begin to...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...divorce, and then the whole circus begins!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They may hope that by becoming occupied with something else they will get out of their boredom.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, by going to church, etc. Any escape is an occupation. So I am asking whether this psychological knowledge is not a factor of the shrinkage of the brain?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it could be a factor.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If knowledge of your profession or skill can be a factor, then this psychological knowledge is stronger.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Much stronger.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>When you say psychological knowledge you are making a distinction between psychological knowledge and, let us say, scientific knowledge or factual knowledge?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, we have said that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>But I am a little wary of the claim that scientific knowledge and other types of factual knowledge help to extend the brain, to make it bigger. That in itself doesn’t lead anywhere. Though it postpones energy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Dr. Bohm makes this very clear. Rational thinking becomes merely routine; I think logically, and therefore I have learned the trick of that, but I keep on repeating it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>That is what happens in most forms of rational thinking.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that there is a dependence on being faced with continual problems.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, lawyers may feel that their brains will last longer, because they are presented with constantly different problems, and therefore they cannot think entirely according to routine!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But, just a minute! They may have different clients with different problems, but they are acting from fixed knowledge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They would not say entirely, they have got to find new facts, and so on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They are not functioning entirely in routine but the basis is knowledge - precedence and book knowledge and experience with various clients.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But then you would have to say that some other more subtle degeneration of the brain takes place, not merely shrinkage.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. That’s what I want to get at.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, when a baby is born, the brain cells have very few cross connections; these gradually increase in number, and then, as a person approaches senility, they begin to go back. So the quality of those cross connections could be wrong. If, for example, we repeated them too often, they would get too fixed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Are all the brain functions confined to rational forms, or are there some functions which have a different quality?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it is known that a large part of the brain deals with movement of the body, with muscles, with various organs and so on, and this part does not shrink with age, although the part that deals with rational thought, if it is not used, does shrink. Then there may be other functions that are totally unknown; that is, very little is actually known about the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What we are saying is that we are only using one part of the brain. There is only partial activity, partial occupation, either rational or irrational. But as long as the brain is occupied it must be in that limited area. Would you say that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then what will happen when it is not occupied? We can say that it may tend to spend most of the time occupied in the limited set of functions which are mechanical, and that this will produce some subtle degeneration of the brain tissue, since anything like that will affect the brain tissue.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are we saying that senility is the result of a mechanical way of living? Of mechanical knowledge, so that the brain has no freedom, no space?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is the suggestion. It is not necessarily accepted by all the people who work on the brain. They have shown that the brain cells start to die around the age of thirty or forty at a steady rate, but this may be a factor. I don’t think their measurements are so good that they can test effectively how the brain is used. You see, they are merely rough measurements, made statistically. But you want to propose that this death or degeneration of the brain cells comes from the wrong way of using the brain?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. That is what I am trying to get at.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and there is a little bit of evidence from the scientists, although I think that they don’t know very much about it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see, scientists, brain specialists, are, if I may put it simply, examining things outside, but not taking themselves as guinea-pigs, and not going into that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Mostly, you see, except for those who do bio-feedback, they are trying to work on themselves in a very indirect way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but I feel we haven’t time for all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is too slow, and it isn’t very deep.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So let’s come back to the realization that any activity which is repeated, which is directed in the narrow sense, any method, any routine, logical or illogical, does affect the brain. We have understood that very clearly. Knowledge at a certain level is essential, but psychological knowledge about oneself, one’s experiences, etc. becomes routine. The images I have about myself also obviously become routine, and all that helps to bring about a shrinkage of the brain. I have understood all that very clearly. And any kind of occupation, apart from the mechanical... no, not mechanical...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...physical.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...apart from physical occupation, brings about shrinkage of the brain. Now how is this process to stop? And if it does stop, will there be a renewal?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that some brain scientists would doubt that the brain cells could be renewed, and I don’t know that there is any proof one way or the other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think they can be renewed. That is what I want to get at.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So we have to discuss that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Are you implying that mind is different from the brain, that mind is distinct from the brain?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You have spoken of universal mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Mind, in the sense that one has access to this mind, and it is not the brain. Do you consider that a possibility?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t quite follow this. I would say that the mind is all-inclusive. When it is all-inclusive, of brain, emotions - all that; when it is totally whole, not divisive in itself, there is a quality which is universal. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>One has access to it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not one: no, you can’t reach it. You can’t say, I have access to it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>I am only saying access. One doesn’t possess it, but...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You can’t possess the sky!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>No, my point is, is there a way of being open to it and is there a function of the mind through which the whole of it can become accessible?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think there is. We may come to that presently if we can stick to this point: We are asking now, can the brain renew itself, rejuvenate, become young again without any shrinkage at all? I think it can. I want to open a new chapter and discuss this. Psychologically, knowledge that man has acquired is crippling it. The Freudians, the Jungians, the latest psychologist, the latest psychotherapist, are all helping to make the brain shrink. Sorry! I don’t mean to give offence...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Is there a way of forgetting this knowledge then?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. Not forgetting. I see what psychological knowledge is doing and I see the waste; I see what is taking place if I follow that line. It is obvious. So I don’t follow that avenue at all. I discard analysis altogether. That is a pattern we have learnt, not only from the recent psychologists and psychotherapists but also through the tradition of a million years of analysis, of introspect, or of saying, ‘I must’, and ‘I must not’, ‘This is right and that is wrong’. You know the whole process. I personally don’t do it, and so I reject that whole method.</p>
<p>We are coming to a point, which is direct perception and immediate action. Our perception is generally directed by knowledge, by the past, which is knowledge perceiving, and with action arising, acting from that. This is a factor of shrinking of the brain, of senility.</p>
<p>Is there a perception which is not time-binding? And so action which is immediate? Am I making myself clear? That is, as long as the brain, which has evolved through time, is still living in a pattern of time, it is becoming senile. If we could break that pattern of time, the brain has broken out of its pattern, and therefore something else takes place.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>How does the brain break out of the pattern of time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We will come to that, but first let’s see if we agree.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, you are saying that the brain is the pattern of time, and perhaps this should be clarified. I think that what you mean by analysis is some sort of process based on past knowledge, which organizes our perception, and in which we take a series of steps to try to accumulate knowledge about the whole thing. And now you say that this is a pattern of time, and we have to break out of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If we agree that this is so, the brain is functioning in a pattern of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then we have to ask, what other pattern is possible?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But wait...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What other movement is possible?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. First let’s understand this, not merely verbally, but let’s actually see that it is happening. That our action, our way of living, our whole thinking, is bound by time, or comes with the knowledge of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Certainly our thinking about ourselves, any attempt to analyse ourselves, to think about ourselves, involves this process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>This process, which is of time. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>That is a difficulty: when you say knowledge and experience, they are a certain cohesive energy or force that binds you.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which means what? Time-binding!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Time-binding and...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...and therefore the pattern of centuries, of millennia, is being repeated.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Yes. But I am saying that this has a certain cohesive force.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course. All illusions have an extraordinary vitality.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Very few break through.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Look at all the churches and what immense vitality they have.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>No, apart from these churches, one’s personal life, it has a certain cohesive force that keeps one back. One can’t break away from it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What do you mean, it keeps you back?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>It has a magnetic attraction, it sort of pulls you back. You can’t free yourself of it unless you have some instrument with which you can act.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are going to find out if there is a different approach to the problem.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>When you say, a different instrument, that is not clear. The whole notion of an instrument involves time, because if you use any instrument, it is a process which you plan.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Time; that’s just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>That is why I use the word ‘instrument’; I mean, it is effective.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It has not been effective. On the contrary, it is destructive. So do I see the very truth of its destructiveness? Not just the theory, the idea, but the actuality of it. If I do, then what takes place? The brain has evolved through time, and has been functioning, living, acting, believing in that time process. But when one realizes that all this helps to make the brain senile, when one sees that as true, then what is the next step?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Are you implying that the very seeing that it is destructive is a releasing factor?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>And there is no need for an extra instrument?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Don’t use the word instrument.</p>
<p>There is no other factor. We are concerned to end this shrinkage and senility, and in asking whether the brain itself, the cells, the whole thing, can move out of time? I am not talking about immortality, and all that kind of stuff! Can the brain move out of time altogether? Otherwise deterioration, shrinkage and senility are inevitable, and even when senility may not show, the brain cells are becoming weaker, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>If the brain cells are material and physical, somehow or other they have to shrink through time; indeed it can’t be helped. The brain cell, which is tissue, cannot in physical terms be immortal.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps the rate of shrinkage would be greatly slowed down. If a person lives a certain number of years, and his brain begins to shrink long before he dies, then he becomes senile. Now if the deterioration would slow down then...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...not only slow down, Sir.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...Well, regenerate...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...be in a state of non-occupation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think Narayan is saying that it is impossible for any material system to last for ever.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not talking about lasting for ever - though I am not sure if it can’t last for ever! No, this is very serious, I am not pulling anybody’s leg.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If all the cells were to regenerate in the body and in the brain, then the whole thing could go on indefinitely.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Look, we are now destroying the body, through drink, smoking, overindulgence in sex and all kinds of things. We are living most unhealthily. Right? If the body were in excellent health, maintained right through - which means no heightened emotions, no strain, no sense of deterioration, the heart functioning normally - then why not?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...which means what? No travelling, and all the rest of it...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No excitement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If the body remains in one quiet place I am sure it can last a great many more years than it does now.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I think that is true. There have been many cases of people living for a hundred and fifty years in quiet places. I think that is all you are talking about. You are not really suggesting something lasting for ever?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So the body can be kept healthy, and since the body affects the mind, nerves, senses and all that, they also can be kept healthy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And if the brain is kept in the right action...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...yes, without any strain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see the brain has a tremendous effect on organizing the body. The pituitary gland controls the entire system of the body glands; also all the organs of the body are controlled by the brain. When the mind deteriorates, the body starts to deteriorate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They work together.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They go together. So can this brain - which is not ‘my’ brain - which has evolved through millions of years, which has had all kinds of destructive or pleasant experiences...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You mean it is a typical brain, not a particular brain, peculiar to some individual? When you say ‘not mine’, you mean any brain belonging to mankind, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Any brain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They are all basically similar.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Similar: that is what I said. Can that brain be free of all this? Of time? I think it can.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps we could discuss what it means to be free of time. You see, at first the suggestion that the brain be free of time might sound crazy, but, obviously, we all know that you don’t mean that the clock stops.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Science fiction and all that!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The point is, what does it really mean to be psychologically free of time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That there is no tomorrow.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But we know there is tomorrow.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But psychologically...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Can you describe better what you mean when you say ‘no tomorrow’?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What does it mean to be living in time? Let’s take the other side first, because then we come to the other. What does it mean to live in time? Hope; thinking and living in the past, and acting from the knowledge of the past; images, illusions, prejudices - they are all an outcome of the past. All that is time, and that is producing chaos in the world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, suppose we say that if we are not living psychologically in time, we may still order our actions by the watch. The thing that is puzzling is if somebody says, I am not living in time, but I must keep an appointment. You see?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course; you can’t sit here for ever.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So you say, I am looking at the watch, but I am not psychologically extending how I am going to feel in the next hour, when I have fulfilment of desire, etc.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am just saying that the way we are living now is in the field of time. And there we have brought all kinds of problems and suffering. Is that right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but it should be made clear why this necessarily produces suffering. You are saying that if you live in the field of time suffering is inevitable.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Inevitable.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is simple. Time has built the ego, the ‘me’, the image of me sustained by society, by education, which has built through millions of years. All that is the result of time. And from there I act.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Towards the future psychologically; that is, towards some future state of being.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Which means that the centre is always becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Trying to become better.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Better, nobler, or anything else. So all that, the constant endeavour to become something psychologically, is a factor of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that the endeavour to become produces suffering?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously. It is simple. All that is divisive. It divides me from others, and so you are different from me. And when I depend on somebody, and that somebody is gone, I feel lonely and miserable. All that goes on.</p>
<p>So we are saying that any factor of division, which is the very nature of the self, must inevitably cause suffering.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that through time the self is set up, and then the self introduces division and conflict and so on? But that if there were no psychological time, then perhaps this entire structure would collapse, and something entirely different would happen?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. That is what I am saying. And therefore the brain itself has broken up.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that is the next step - to say that the brain has broken out of that rut, and perhaps could then regenerate. It doesn’t follow logically, but still it could be so.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think it does follow logically.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it follows logically that it would stop degenerating.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And are you adding further that it would start to regenerate?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You look sceptical?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Yes, because the whole human predicament is bound to time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We know that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Society, individuals, the whole structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know, I know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>It is so forceful that anything feeble doesn’t work here.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What do you mean - ‘feeble’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>The force of this is so great that what has to break through must have tremendous energy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>And no individual seems to be able to generate sufficient energy to be able to break through.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But you have got hold of the wrong end of the stick, if I may point this out. When you use the word ‘individual’, you have moved away from the fact that our brain is universal.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Yes, I admit that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is no individuality.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>That brain is conditioned this way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, we have been through all that. It is conditioned this way through time. Time is conditioning - right? It is not that time has created the conditioning, time itself is the factor of conditioning.</p>
<p>So can that time element not exist? (We are talking about psychological time, not the ordinary physical time.) I say it can. We have said that the ending of suffering comes about when the self, which is built up through time, is no longer there. A man who is actually going through agony might reject this. But when he comes out of the shock of it, if somebody points out to him what is happening, and if he is willing to listen, to see the rationality, the sanity of it, and not to build a wall against it, he is out of that field. The brain is out of that time-binding quality.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Temporarily.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah! There again when you use the word ‘temporary’, it means time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>No, I mean that the man slips back into time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, he can’t. He can’t go back if he sees that something is dangerous, like a cobra, or any other danger, he cannot go back to it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>That analogy is a bit difficult, because the structure itself is that danger. One inadvertently slips into it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>When you see a dangerous animal, there is immediate action. It may be the result of past knowledge and experience, but there is immediate action for self-protection. But psychologically we are unaware of the dangers. If we become as aware of these dangers as we are aware of physical dangers, there is an action which is not time-binding.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I think you could say that as long as you could perceive this danger you know you would respond immediately. But you see, if you were to use that analogy of the animal, it might be an animal that you realize is dangerous, but he might take another form that you don’t see as dangerous!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Therefore there would be a danger of slipping back if you didn’t see this. Or illusion might come in some other form.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I think the major point you are making is that the brain is not belonging to any individual.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And therefore it is no use saying that the individual slips back.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because that already denies what you are saying. The danger is rather that the brain might slip back.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The brain itself might slip back, because it has not seen the danger.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It hasn’t seen the other forms of the illusions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The Holy Ghost taking different shapes! All this is the real root of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Time, and separation as individuality, are basically the same structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Although it is not obvious in the beginning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wonder if we see that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It might be worth discussing that. Why is psychological time the same illusion, the same structure as individuality? Individuality is the sense of being a person who is located here somewhere.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Located and divided.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Divided from the others. He extends out to some periphery, his domain extends out to some periphery, and also he has an identity which extends over time. He wouldn’t regard himself as an individual if he said ‘Today I am one person, tomorrow I am another’. So it seems that we mean by individual somebody who is in time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think that this idea of individuality is a fallacy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but many people may find it hard to be convinced that it is a fallacy. There is a common feeling that, as an individual, I have existed at least from my birth if not before, and go on to death, and perhaps later. The whole idea of being an individual is to be in time. Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>To be in psychological time, not just the time of the clock.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, we are saying that. So can that illusion that time has created individuality be broken? Can this brain understand that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that, as Narayan said, there is a great momentum in the brain, which keeps rolling, moving along.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can that momentum stop?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>The difficulty comes here. The genetic coding is intrinsic to a person. He seems to function more or less unconsciously, driven by this past momentum. And suddenly he sees, like a flash, something true. But the difficulty is that it may operate only for a day - and then he is again caught in the old momentum.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know that. But it says the brain will not be caught. Once the mind or the brain is aware of this fact, it cannot go back. How can it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>There must be another way of preventing it from going back.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not preventing: that means also time. You are still thinking in terms of prevention.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Prevention, in the sense of the human factor.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The human being is irrational. Right? And as long as he is functioning irrationally, he says of any rational factor, ‘I refuse to see it’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>You are suggesting that the very seeing prevents you from slipping back. This is a human condition.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I wonder if we should go further into this question about prevention. It may be important.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>There are two aspects. You see the fallacy of something, and the very seeing prevents you from slipping back, because you see the danger of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In another sense you say you have no temptation to slip back, therefore you don’t have to be prevented. If you really see it, there is no need for conscious prevention.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Then you are not tempted to go back.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I can’t go back. If for example I see the fallacy of all the religious nonsense, it is finished!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The only question which I raise is that you may not see this so completely in another form.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>It may come in different shapes...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...and then you are tempted once again.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The mind is aware, it is not caught. But you are saying that it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Yes, in other shapes and forms.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait Sir. We have said that perception is out of time, is seeing immediately the whole nature of time. Which to use a good old word, is to have an insight into the nature of time. If there is that insight, the very brain cells, which are part of time, break down. The brains cells bring about a change in themselves. You may disagree, you may say, ‘Prove it.’ I say this is not a matter of proof, it is a matter of action. Do it, find out, test it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>You were also saying the other day, that when the consciousness is empty of its content...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...the content being time...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>...that leads to the transformation of the brain cells.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>When you say consciousness is empty of the content there...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...there is no consciousness as we know it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Yes. And you are using the word insight. What is the connection between the two?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Between what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Consciousness and insight. You have suggested that when consciousness is empty of its content...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Be careful. Consciousness is put together by its content. The content is the result of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The content also is time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is about time as well, and it is actually put together by time, also it is about time. But if you have an insight into that, the whole pattern is gone, broken. The insight is not of time, not of memory, is not of knowledge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Who has this insight?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not ‘who’. Simply, there is an insight.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>There is an insight and then the consciousness is empty of its content...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, Sir. No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>You are implying that the very emptying of the content is insight?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. We are saying time is a factor which has made up the content. It has built it up, and it also thinks about it. All that bundle is the result of time. Insight into this whole movement, which is not ‘my’ insight, brings about transformations in the brain. Because that insight is not time-binding.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that this psychological content is a certain structure, physically, in the brain? That in order for this psychological content to exist, the brain over many years has made many connections of the cells, which constitute this content?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite, quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And then there is a flash of insight, which sees all this, and that it is not necessary. Therefore all this begins to dissipate. And when it has dissipated, there is no content. Then, whatever the brain does is something different.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let us go further. Then there is total emptiness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, emptiness of the content. But when you say total emptiness, you mean emptiness of all this inward content?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. And that emptiness has tremendous energy. It is energy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So could you say that the brain, having had all these connections tangled, has locked up a lot of energy?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. Wastage of energy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And when they begin to dissipate, that energy is there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Would you say that it is as much physical energy as any other kind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Now we can go on in more detail, but is this principle, the root of it, an idea or a fact? I hear all this physically with the ear, but I may make it into an idea. If I hear it, not only with the ear, but in my being, in the very structure of myself, what happens then? If that kind of hearing doesn’t take place, all this becomes merely an idea, and I spin along for the rest of my life playing with ideas.</p>
<p>If there was a scientist here, bio-feedback or another brain specialist, would he accept all this? Would he even listen to it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>A few scientists would, but obviously the majority would not.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. So how do we touch the human brain?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All this will sound rather abstract, to most scientists, you see. They will say, it could be so; it is a nice theory, but we have no proof of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. They would say it doesn’t excite them very much because they don’t see any proof.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They would say, if you have some more evidence we will come back later, and become very interested. So you see, you can’t give any proof, because whatever is happening, nobody can see it with their eyes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand. But I am asking, what shall we do? The human brain - not ‘my’ brain or ‘your’, the brain - has evolved through a million years. One biological ‘freak’ can move out of it, but how do you get at the human mind generally to make it see all this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think you have to communicate the necessity, the inevitability of what you are saying. Say if a person sees something happening before his eyes he says, ‘That’s so’. Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it requires somebody to listen, somebody who says, ‘I want to capture it, I want to understand this, I want to find out.’ You follow what I am saying? Apparently that is one of the most difficult things in life.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it is the function of this occupied brain - that it is occupied with itself and it doesn’t listen.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>In fact one of the things is that this occupation starts very early. When you are young it is very powerful, and it continues all through your life. How can we, through education, make this clear?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The moment you see the importance of not being occupied - see that as a tremendous truth - you will find ways and methods to help educationally, creatively. No one can be told, copy and imitate, for then he is lost.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then the question is, how is it possible to communicate to the brain, which rejects, which doesn’t listen? Is there a way?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not if I refuse to listen. You see, I think meditation is a great factor in all this. I feel we have been meditating although ordinarily people wouldn’t accept this as meditation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They have used the word so often...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...that its meaning is really lost. But true meditation is this: the emptying of consciousness. You follow?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but let’s be clear. Earlier you said it would happen through insight. Now are you saying that meditation is conducive to insight?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Meditation is insight.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is insight already. Then is it some sort of work you do? Insight is usually thought of as the flash, but meditation is more constant.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We must be careful. What do we mean by meditation? We can reject the systems, methods, acknowledged authorities, because these are often merely traditional repetitions - time-binding nonsense.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Do you think some of them could have been original, could have had real insight, in the past?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Who knows? Now meditation is this penetration, this sense of moving without any past.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The only point to clear up is that when you use the word meditation, you mean something more than insight, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Much more. Insight has freed the brain from the past, from time. That is an enormous statement...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Do you mean that you have to have insight if you are going to meditate?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s right. To meditate without any sense of becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You cannot meditate without insight. You can’t regard it as a procedure by which you will come to insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. That immediately implies time. A procedure, a system, a method, in order to have insight is nonsensical. Insight into greed or fear frees the mind from them. Then meditation has quite a different quality. It has nothing to do with all the gurus’ meditations. So could we say that to have insight there must be silence?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that is the same; we seem to be going in a circle.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>For the moment.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, my mind has silence.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So the silence of insight has cleansed, purged, all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All that structure of the occupation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Then there is no movement as we know it; no movement of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Is there movement of some other kind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t see how we can measure that by words, that sense of a limitless state.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you were saying earlier that nevertheless it is necessary to find some language, even though it is unsayable!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes - we will find that language.</p>

<h1>10. Cosmic Order</h1>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We left off the other day by saying that when the mind is totally empty of all the things that thought has put there, then real meditation begins. But I would like to go more deeply into that matter, to go back a bit, and find out if the mind, the brain, can ever be free from all illusion and forms of deception. Also whether it can have its own order - an order not introduced by thought, effort or any endeavour to put things in their proper place. And also, however much damaged the brain is by shock and all kinds of situations, whether it can heal itself completely.</p>
<p>So first let’s begin by asking if there is an order which is not made by man or by thought - which is not the result of calculated order out of disturbance, and therefore still part of the old conditioning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>Are you referring to the mind? I mean, you can say the order of nature exists on its own.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The order of nature is order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it is not made by man.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But I am not talking of such. I am not sure that it is that kind of order. Is there cosmic order?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that is still the same thing, in a sense, because the word ‘cosmos’ means order, but the whole order, which includes the order of the universe and the order of the mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. What I am trying to find out is whether there is order which man can never possibly conceive.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, how are we going to discuss it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t know. What is order?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>There is mathematical order, the highest kind of order known to any discipline.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would the mathematicians agree that mathematics is complete order?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Yes, mathematics itself is order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think it depends on the mathematician. But there is a well-known mathematician called von Neumann who defined mathematics as the relationship of relationships. Really he meant, by relationship, order. It is order working within the field of order itself, rather than working on some object.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is what I am trying to get at.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So the most creative mathematicians are having a perception of this, which may be called pure order; but of course it is limited, because it has to be expressed mathematically, in terms of formulae or equations.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Is order part of disorder, as we know it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What we mean by disorder is another question. It is not possible to give a coherent definition of disorder, because it violates order. Anything that actually happens has an order, but you can call a certain thing disorder if you like.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are you saying that anything that happens is order?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Has an order. If the body is not functioning rightly, even if cancer is growing, there is a certain order in the cancer cell; it is just growing according to a different pattern, which tends to break down the body. Nevertheless the whole thing has a certain kind of order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It has not violated the laws of nature, although relative to some context you could say it is disorder, because, if we are talking of the health of the body, then the cancer is called disorder. But in itself...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Cancer has its own order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but it is not compatible with the order of the growth of the body.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. So what do we mean by order? Is there such a thing as order?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Order is a perception; we can’t get hold of order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>I think that generally when we refer to order it is in relation to a framework, or in relation to a certain field. Order always has that connotation. But when you say the order of order, as in the study of mathematics, we are going away from this limited approach to it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see most mathematics start with the order of the numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4, and build on that, in a hierarchy. But you can see what is meant by the order of the numbers. There is for example a series of relationships which are constant. In the order of the numbers, you have the simplest example of order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>And a new order was created with the discovery of zero! Are mathematical order and the order in nature, part of a bigger field? Or are these localized forms?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You see the brain, the mind, is so contradictory, so bruised, that it can’t find order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but what kind of order does it want?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It wants an order in which it will be safe, in which it won’t be bruised, be shocked, or feel physical and psychological pain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The whole point of order and mathematics is not to have contradiction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But the brain is in contradiction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And something has gone wrong.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, we have said that the brain took a wrong turn.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, if the body is growing wrongly we have a cancer cell, which means two contradictory orders - one being the growth of the cancer, and the other the order of the body.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But can the mind, the brain, be totally free of all organized order?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You mean by organized order, a fixed or imposed pattern?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Imposed or self-imposed. We are trying to investigate whether the brain can ever be free from all impositions, pressures, wounds, bruises and trivialities of existence which are pushing it in different directions. If it cannot, meditation has no meaning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You could go further, and say that probably life has no meaning if you cannot free it of all that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I wouldn’t say that life has no meaning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The pattern goes on indefinitely.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If it goes on as it has done, indefinitely, for millennia, life has no meaning. But I think there is a meaning and to find out, the brain must be totally free.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What is the source of what we call disorder? It is like a cancer going on inside the brain, moving in a way which is not compatible with the health of the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It grows as time goes on, it increases from one generation to another.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Each generation repeats the same pattern.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It tends to accumulate through tradition with every generation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How is this set, accumulated pattern, to end, to be broken through?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Could we ask another question? Why does the brain provide the soil for this stuff to grow on?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It may be merely tradition or habit.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But why does the brain stay in that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It feels safe. It is afraid of something new taking place, because in the old tradition it finds refuge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then we have to question why the brain deceives itself. This pattern involves the fact that the brain deceives itself about disorder. It doesn’t seem able to see it clearly.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>In my mind there is intelligence behind order which makes use of it. I have a certain purpose for which I create an order, and when the purpose is over I set aside that order or pattern. So order has an intelligence which works it out. That is the usual connotation. But you are referring to something else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am asking whether this pattern of generations can be broken, and why the brain has accepted that pattern in spite of all its conflicts and misery.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>I am saying the same thing in a different way. When an order has served its purpose, can it then be put aside?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Apparently it can’t. We are speaking psychologically. It can’t. The brain goes on, repeating fears, sorrow, miseries. Is it so heavily conditioned that it cannot see its way out of it, because, by constant repetition, the brain has become dull?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>The momentum of repetition is there?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That momentum makes the mind mechanical. And in that sluggishness it takes refuge and says, ‘It’s all right, I can go on.’ That’s what most human beings do.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is part of the disorder. To think in that way is a manifestation of disorder.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Do you connect order with intelligence? Or is order something that exists on its own?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Intelligence involves order; it requires the perception of order in an orderly way, without contradiction. But I think that, in the terms of this discussion, we ourselves don’t create this; we don’t impose this order, but rather it is natural.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I am the ordinary man. I see that I am caught. My whole way of living and thinking is out of this enormous length of time. Time is my whole existence. In the past, which cannot be changed, I take refuge. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well I think that if we were to talk to the so-called ordinary man, we would find he doesn’t really understand that time is something that happens to him.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am saying an ordinary man can see, after talking over with another, that his whole existence is based on time. And the mind takes refuge in time - in the past.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What does that mean exactly? How does it take refuge?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because the past cannot be changed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but people also think of the future. It is common to think that the future can change. The Communists have said, give up the past, we are going to change the future.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But we can’t give up the past, even if we think we can.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then if even those who try not to take refuge in the past, can’t give it up, it seems that whatever we do, we are stuck.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So the next step is, why does the brain accept this way of living? Why doesn’t it break it down? Is it through laziness or that in breaking it down it has no hope?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is still the same question, of going from past to future.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. So what is the brain to do? This is applicable to most people, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We haven’t understood why, when people see that their behaviour is disorderly or irrational, they try to give up the past, but find they cannot.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait, Sir. If I give up the past, I have no existence. If I give up all my remembrances, I have nothing; I am nothing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think some people like the Marxists would look at it a little differently. Marx said that it is necessary to transform the conditions of human society and that this will remove the past.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it has not done so. It cannot be done.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is because when man tries to transform it he still works from the past.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s what I am saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If you say, don’t depend on the past at all, then, as you have asked, what are we going to do?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am nothing: is that the reason why we cannot possibly give up the past? Because my existence, my way of thinking, my life, everything, is from the past. And if you say, wipe that out, what have I left?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think you could say that obviously we have to keep certain things from the past, like useful knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, we have been through all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you could ask, suppose we keep that useful part of the past, and wipe out all aspects of the past which are contradictory?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which are all psychologically contradictory. Then what is left? Just going to the office? There is nothing. Is that the reason why we cannot give it up?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is still a contradiction in that, because if you say, ‘what is left’, you are still asking from the past.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you simply saying that when people talk of giving up the past, they are just not doing it, but merely turning this into another question which avoids the issue?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because my whole being is the past; it has changed or been modified, but its roots are in the past.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now if you said, ‘All right, give all that up and in the future you will have something quite different, and better’, would people then be attracted to this?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But ‘better’ is still from the past.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But people want to be assured of at least something.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is just it. There is nothing. The ordinary human being wants something to which he can cling.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>He may feel, not that he is clinging to the past, but reaching for something.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If I reach something it is still the past.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it has its roots in the past, but that is not often obvious, because people say it is a big, new revolutionary situation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As long as I have my roots in the past there cannot be order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because the past is pervaded with disorder.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And is my mind, my brain, willing to see that there is absolutely nothing if I give up the past?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And nothing to reach for.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Nothing. There is no movement. Sometimes people dangle a carrot in front of me and, foolishly, I follow it. But I see that there are really no carrots, no rewards or punishments. Then how is this past to be dissolved? Because otherwise I am still living in the field of time that is man-made. So what shall I do? Am I willing to face absolute emptiness?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What will you tell somebody who is not willing to face this?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not bothered. If somebody says that he can’t do all this, I say, ‘Well, carry on’.</p>
<p>But I am willing to let my past go completely. Which means there is no effort or reward; nothing. And the brain is willing to face this extraordinary and totally new state of existing in nothingness. That is appallingly frightening.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Even these words will have their meaning rooted in the past.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. We have understood that; the word is not the thing. The mind says it is willing to do that, to face this absolute emptiness, because it has seen for itself that all the places where it has taken refuge are illusions...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think this leaves out something that you brought up earlier - the question of the damage of scars to the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The brain that isn’t damaged could possibly let go the past fairly readily.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Look, can I discover what has caused damage to the brain? Surely one of the factors is strong, sustained emotions, like hatred.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Probably a flash of emotion doesn’t do so much damage, but people sustain it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Hatred, anger and violence not only shock but wound the brain. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And getting excessively excited.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course; and drugs, etc. The natural response doesn’t damage the brain. Now the brain is damaged; suppose it has been damaged through anger.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You could even say that nerves probably get connected up in the wrong way, and that the connections are too fixed. I think there is evidence that these things will actually change the structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, and can we have an insight into the whole nature of disturbance, so that the insight changes the cells of the brain which have been wounded?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, possibly it would start them healing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. That healing must be immediate.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It may take time in the sense that, if wrong connections hade been made, it is going to take time to redistribute the material. The beginning of it, it seems to me, is immediate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. Can I do that? I have listened to ‘X’, I have carefully read, I have thought about all this, and I see that anger, violence, hatred - any excessive emotion - bruises the brain. And insight into this whole business brings about a mutation in the cells. It is so. Also the nerves - the adjustments, will be as rapid as possible.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Something happens with cancer cells. Sometimes the cancer suddenly stops growing, and it goes the other way, for some reason that is unknown. But a change must have taken place in those cells.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Could it be that the brain cells change fundamentally, and the cancer process stops?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Fundamentally it stops, and begins to dismantle.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Dismantle, yes that is it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>You are saying that insight sets into motion the right kind of connections, and stops the wrong connections?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And it even dismantles the wrong connections.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>So a beginning is made, and it is made now.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>At one moment.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is the insight.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>But there is no time involved, because the right movement has started now.</p>
<p>There is another thing which I want to ask about the past: for most people, the past means pleasure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not only pleasure but the remembrance of everything.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>One starts disliking pleasure only when it becomes stale, or leads to difficulties. One wants pleasure all the time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between pleasure and the staleness or the difficulties that it brings.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Pleasure is always the past; there is no pleasure at the moment it is happening. That comes in later, when it is remembered. So the remembrance is the past. But I am willing to face nothingness which means to wipe out all that!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>But I am saying that the human being, even though he understands what you are saying, is held back in this field.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because he is not willing to face this emptiness. Pleasure is not compassion. Pleasure is not love, pleasure has no place in compassion. But perhaps if there is this mutation, compassion is stronger than pleasure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Even the perception of order may be stronger than pleasure. If people are really concerned with something, the pleasure plays no role at that moment.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>But what happens to a man in whom pleasure is dominant?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have already discussed this. As long as he is unwilling to face this extraordinary emptiness, he will keep on with the old pattern.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, we have to say that this man had a damaged brain too. It is brain damage which causes this emphasis on pleasure, as well as the fear and the anger.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But the damaged brain is healed when there is insight.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. But I think many people who would understand that hate and anger are products of the damaged brain would find it hard to see that pleasure also is the product of the damaged brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes, but of course it is.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Can we say there is a true enjoyment, which is not the product of the damaged brain, which is confused with pleasure...?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>If pleasure gives rise to anger, anger is part of the damaged brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And also the demand for pleasure.</p>
<p>So do you have an insight into how very destructive the past is to the brain? Can the brain itself see, have an insight into this, and move out of it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>You are saying that the beginning of order comes from insight?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously. Let’s work from there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>May I put it in a different way? Is it possible to gather a certain amount of order in a pattern sense, artificially, so that it gives rise to a certain amount of insight?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah! You cannot find truth through the false.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>I am asking it purposefully because many people seem to lack the energy that is required for insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You are tremendously keen to earn a livelihood, to earn money, to do anything in which you are really interested. If you are interested vitally in this transformation, etc., you have the energy.</p>
<p>May we go on? I, as a human being, have seen that this insight has wiped away the past, and the brain is willing to live in nothingness. Right? We have come to this point several times from different directions. Now let’s go on. Now there isn’t a thing put there by thought. There is no movement of thought, except factual knowledge which has its own place. But talking psychologically, there is no movement in the mind or of thought. There is absolutely nothing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You mean no feeling either? You see, the movement of thought and feeling is together.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait a minute. What do you mean here by feeling?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, usually people might say, all right, there is no thought, but they have various feelings.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course we have feelings.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>These are sensations. And also there are the inner feelings.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Inner feelings of what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is hard to describe them. Those that can easily be described are obviously the wrong kind, such as anger and fear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is compassion a feeling?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Probably not.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it is not a feeling.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Though people may say they feel compassionate! Even the very word suggests it is a form of feeling. Compassion has in it the word ‘passion’, which is feeling. This is a difficult question. We could perhaps question what we usually recognize as feelings?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s go into that a little bit. What do we mean by feelings? Sensations?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, people don’t usually mean that. You see, sensations are connected with the body.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So you are talking of feelings which are not of the body?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, or which - in the old days - would have been described as of the soul.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The soul, of course. That is an easy escape but it means nothing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What are the inner feelings? Pleasure?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, in so far as you could label it, that description would not be valid.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what is valid? The non-verbal state?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It may be a non-verbal state... something analogous to a feeling which isn’t fixed, that can’t be named.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>You are saying it is not feeling, it is similar to feeling, but it is not fixed?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. I am just considering that that could exist if we say that there is no thought. I am trying to clarify this.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, there is no thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What does that really mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What it really means is, thought is movement, thought is time. Right? In that emptiness there is not time or thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and perhaps no sense of the existence of an entity inside.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Absolutely, of course. The existence of the entity is the bundle of memories, the past.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But that existence is not only thought thinking about it, but also the feeling that it is there; you get a sort of feeling inside.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>A feeling, yes. There is no being. There is nothing. If there is a feeling of the being continuing...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, even though it doesn’t seem possible to verbalize this... It would be a state without desire. How can we know if this state is real, is genuine?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am asking. How do we know, or realize that this is so? In other words, do you want proof of it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Not proof, but communication of that state.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now wait a minute. Suppose someone has this peculiar compassion, how can he communicate it to me, if I am living in pleasure and all that? He can’t!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>No, but I am prepared to listen to him.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Prepared to listen, but how deeply? The man says there is no being. And one’s whole life has been this becoming. And, in that state, he says there is no being at all. In other words, there is no ‘me’. Right? Now you say, ‘Show it to me’. It can be shown only through certain qualities that it has, certain actions. What are the actions of a mind that is totally empty of being? Actions at what level? Actions in the physical world?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Partly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Mostly that. All right, this man has got this sense of emptiness, and there is no being. He is not acting from self-centred interests. His actions are in the world of daily living, and you can judge whether he is a hypocrite, whether he says something and contradicts it the next moment, or whether he is actually living this compassion and not just saying, ‘I feel compassionate’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But if one is not doing the same, one can’t tell.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. That is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>We can’t judge him.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You can’t. So how can he convey to us in words that peculiar quality of mind? He can describe, go round it, but he can’t give the essence of it. Dr. Bohm, for example, could discuss with Einstein; they were on the same level. And he and I can discuss. If one has this sense of not being, of emptiness, the other can go very close, but can never enter that mind unless he has it!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Is there any way of communicating, for one who is open, but not through words?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are talking of compassion. It is not, ‘I feel compassionate’. That is altogether wrong. You see, in daily life such a mind acts without the ‘me’, without the ‘ego’. Therefore it might make a mistake, but it corrects immediately; it is not carrying that mistake.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>It is not stuck.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not stuck. But we must be very careful here not to find an excuse for wrong!</p>
<p>So we come to that point that we discussed earlier; what then is meditation? Right? For the man who is becoming, meditation has no meaning whatsoever. That is a tremendous statement. When there is not this being or becoming, what is meditation? It must be totally unconscious, totally uninvited.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Do you mean, without conscious intention?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I think that is right. Would you say - I hope this doesn’t sound silly - that the universe, the cosmic order, is in meditation?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, if it is alive, then we would have to look at it that way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. It is in a state of meditation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think that is right. I stick to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We should try to go further into what is meditation. What is it doing?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>If you say that the universe is in meditation, is the expression of it order? What order can we discern which would indicate cosmic or universal meditation?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The sunrise and sunset; all the stars, the planets are order. The whole thing is in perfect order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to connect this with meditation. According to the dictionary, the meaning of meditation is to reflect, to turn something over in the mind, and to pay close attention.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And also to measure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is a further meaning, but it is to weigh, to ponder, it means ‘measure’ in the sense of weighing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Weighing, that’s it. Ponder, think over, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>To weigh the significance of something. Now is that what you mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then why do you use the word?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>I am told that, in English, contemplation has a different connotation from meditation. Contemplation implies a deeper state of mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is hard to know. The word ‘contemplate’ comes from the word temple, really.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Its basic meaning is, to create an open space.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that an open space between God and me?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is the way the word arose.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>The Sanskrit word Dhyans doesn’t have the same connotation as meditation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Because meditation has the overtones of measurement, and probably, in an oblique way, that measurement is order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I don’t want to bring in order - let’s leave the word order out. We have been through that, and beaten it to death!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why do you use the word meditation?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don’t let’s use it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s find out what you really mean here.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would you say, a state of infinity? A measureless state?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>There is no division of any kind. You see we are giving lots of descriptions, but it is not that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but is there any sense of the mind being in some way aware of itself?</p>
<p>Is that what you are trying to say? At other times you have said that the mind is emptying itself of content.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What are you trying to get at?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I am asking whether it is not only infinite, but if something more is involved?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, much more.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We said that content is the past which is making disorder. Then you could say that this emptying of content in some sense is constantly cleaning up the past. Would you agree to that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>When you say the mind is emptying itself of content...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Has emptied itself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All right, then. When the past is cleaned up, then you say that is meditation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is meditation; no, contemplation...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>Just a beginning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Beginning?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>The emptying of the past.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That emptying of the past, which is anger, jealousy, beliefs, dogmas, attachments, etc., must be done. If that is not emptied, if any part of that exists, it will inevitably lead to illusion. The brain or the mind must be totally free of all illusion, illusion brought by desire, by hope, by wanting security, and all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are you saying that when this is done, it opens the door to something broader, deeper?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Otherwise life has no meaning; it is just repeating this pattern.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Narayan: </span>What exactly did you mean when you said that the universe is in meditation?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I feel that way, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Could we say first of all that the universe is not actually governed by its past? You see, the universe creates certain forms which are relatively constant, so that people who look at it superficially only see that, and it seems then to be determined from the past.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, it is not governed by the past. It is creative, moving.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And then this movement is order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Would you, as a scientist, accept such a thing?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well as a matter of fact I would!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are we both crazy? Let’s put the question another way: is it really possible for time to end - the whole idea of time as the past - chronologically, so that there is no tomorrow at all? There is the feeling, the actual reality, psychologically, of having no tomorrow. I think that is the healthiest way of living - which doesn’t mean that I become irresponsible! That would be too childish.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is merely a question of physical time, which is a certain part of natural order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course; that is understood.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The question is whether we have a sense of experiencing past and future or whether we are free of that sense.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am asking you, as a scientist, is the universe based on time?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I would say no, but you see the general way...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is all I want. You say no! And can the brain, which has evolved in time...?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, has it evolved in time? Rather it has become entangled in time. Because the brain is part of the universe, which we say is not based on time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I agree.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Thought has entangled the brain in time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. Can that entanglement be unravelled, freed, so that the universe is the mind? You follow? If the universe is not of time, can the mind, which has been entangled in time, unravel itself and so be the universe? You follow what I am trying to say?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is order. And would you say that it is meditation?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is it. I would call that meditation, not in the ordinary, dictionary sense of pondering, and all that, but a state of meditation in which there is no element of the past.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You say the mind is disentangling itself from time, and also really disentangling the brain from time?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, would you accept that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As a theory?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, as a proposal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I don’t want it as a proposal.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What do you mean by theory?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Theory - when somebody comes along and says, this is real meditation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All right.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Wait. Somebody says, one can live this way; life has an extraordinary meaning in it, full of compassion, etc., and every act in the physical world can be corrected immediately, and so on. Would you, as a scientist, accept such a state, or say that the man who talks of it is cuckoo?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, I wouldn’t say that. I feel it is perfectly possible; it is quite compatible with anything that I know about nature.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, then that’s all right. So one is not an unbalanced cuckoo! Of course putting all this into words is not the thing. Right? That is understood. But can it be communicated to another? Now can some of us get to this, so that we can communicate it, actually?</p>

<h1>11. The Liberation of Insight</h1>

<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have asked what is the origin of all human movement. Is there an original source, a ground from which all this - nature, man, the whole universe - sprang? Is it bound by time? Is it in itself complete order, beyond which there is nothing more?</p>
<p>And we have talked about order, whether the universe is based on time at all, and whether man can ever comprehend and live in that supreme order. We want to investigate, not merely intellectually but also profoundly, how to comprehend and live, move from that ground, that ground that is timeless, and beyond which there is nothing. Can we go on from there?</p>
<p>I don’t know if, as a scientist, you will agree that there is such a ground, or that man can ever comprehend it, live in it; not in the sense that he is living in it, but that itself is living? Can we as human beings come to that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm:</span>I don’t know if science as it is now constituted can say much about that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Science doesn’t talk about it, but would you, as a scientist, give your mind to the investigation of that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I think that implicitly science has always been concerned with trying to come to this ground, but to attempt it by studying matter to the greatest possible depth, of course, is not enough.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Didn’t we ask if a human being, living in this world that is in such turmoil, can be in absolute order first, as the universe is in absolute order, and comprehend an order which is universal?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I can have order in myself, by careful observation, self-study, self-investigation, and understanding the nature of disorder. The very insight of that understanding dispels disorder. That’s one level of order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that’s the level that most of us have been concerned with till now, you see. We see this disorder going on in the world and in ourselves, and we say it is necessary to be aware of it and to observe it and, as you say, to dispel it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But that’s a very small affair.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but we agreed that people generally don’t feel it is a small affair. They feel that clearing up the disorder in themselves and the world would be a very big thing, and perhaps all that is necessary.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But I am referring to the fairly intelligent, knowledgeable, and cultured human being - “cultured” meaning civilized. He can, with a great deal of enquiry and investigation, come to the point when he can bring order in himself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then some people would say, if only we could bring that order into the whole of society.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Well, we will, if human beings are all tremendously orderly in that inward sense, perhaps create a new society. But that again is a very small affair.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I understand that, but I feel we should go into it carefully because people commonly don’t see it as small. Only a few have seen that there’s something beyond that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Much more beyond that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps it might be worth thinking about why it is not enough to go into the order of man and society, just to produce orderly living. In what sense is that not enough?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because we live in chaos. We think that to bring order is a tremendous affair, but in itself it isn’t. I can put my room in order, so that it gives me certain space, certain freedom; I know where things are, I can go directly to them. That’s a physical order. Can I put things in myself in order, which means not to have conflict, not to have comparison, not to have any sense of “me” and “you” and “they,” everything that brings about such division, out of which grows conflict? That’s simple. If I’m a Hindu and you are a Muslim, we are eternally at war with each other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and in every community people fall apart in the same way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All society breaks up that way, but if one understands that, and profoundly realizes it, it’s finished.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Suppose we say we have achieved that. Then what? I think some people might feel it’s so far away that it doesn’t interest them. They might say, wait till we achieve it before we worry about the other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right, sir, let’s start again. I’m in disorder, physically and psychologically. Around me the society in which I live is also utterly confused. There is a great deal of injustice; it is a miserable affair. I can see that very simply. I can see that my generation and past generations have contributed to this. And I can do something about it. That’s simple. I can say, well, I’ll put my house in order. The house is myself and it must be in order before I can move further.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But suppose somebody says, “My house is not in order”?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right, my house is in disorder. Then let me put it in order, which is fairly simple. If I apply my mind and my heart to the resolution of that, it’s fairly clear. But we don’t want to do that. We find it tremendously difficult because we are so bound to the past, to our habits and our attitudes. We don’t seem to have the energy, the courage, the vitality, to move out of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What’s not simple is to know what will produce that energy and courage. What will change all this?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think that what will change all this is to have an insight into it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The key point seems to be that without insight, nothing can change.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Will insight really alter the whole structure and nature of my being? That is the question, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What seems to be implied is that if we look at a rather small question like the order of daily life, it will not involve our whole being.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, of course not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And therefore the insight will be inadequate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, it’s like being tied to something, to a belief, to a person, an idea, some habit, some experience. That inevitably must create disorder, because being tied implies dependence, the escape from one’s own loneliness, fear. Now, total insight into that attachment clears it all away.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. I think we are saying that the self is a centre creating darkness or clouds in the mind, and insight penetrates that. It could dispel the clouds so that there would be clarity and the problem would vanish.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right, vanish.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But that would take a very intense, total insight.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right, but are we willing to go through that? Or is our attachment or tie to something so strong that we’re unwilling to let go? That is the case with most people. Unfortunately, it’s only the very few who want to do this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Now, can insight wipe away, banish, dissolve the whole movement of being tied, attached, dependent, lonely, with one blow as it were? I think it can. I think it happens when there is profound insight. That insight is not merely the movement of memory, knowledge, experience; it is totally different from all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is insight into the whole of disorder, into the source of all disorder of a psychological nature.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>With that insight, the mind can clear up, and then it would be possible to approach the cosmic order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s what I want to get at. That’s much more interesting than this. Any serious man must put his house in order. And that must be complete order, order in the whole of man, not order in a particular direction. The particular resolution of a particular problem is not the resolution of the whole.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The key point is that finding the source, the root that generates the whole, is the only way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because if we try to deal with a particular problem, it’s still always coming from the source.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The source is the “me.” That little source, little pond, little stream, apart from the great source must dry up.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the little stream confuses itself with the great one, I think.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, we’re not talking about the great stream, the immense movement of life; we’re talking about the little “me” with the little movement, little apprehensions, and so on, that is creating disorder. As long as that centre, which is the very essence of disorder, is not dissolved, there is no order.</p>
<p>So at that level it is clear. Can we go on from there? Now, is there another order totally different from this? This is man-made disorder, and therefore man-made order. The human mind, realizing that and seeing the disorder that it can bring about in itself, then begins to ask if there is an order that is totally different, of a dimension which it is necessary to find, because this man-made order is such a small affair.</p>
<p>I can put my house in order. All right. Then what? Perhaps if many of us do it, we’ll have a better society. That is admitted, relevant, necessary, but it has its limitation. Now, a human being who has really deeply understood the disorder made by human beings and its effect on society asks, “Is there an order that is beyond all this?” The human mind isn’t satisfied with merely physical order. That has limitations, boundaries, so he says, “I’ve understood that; let’s move.”</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>How do we get into that question? Even in science, men seek the order of the universe looking to the end or the beginning or to the depth of its structure. Many have sought the absolute, and the word “absolute” means free of all limitation, all dependence, all imperfection. The “absolute” has been the source of tremendous illusion, of course, because the limited self seeks to capture the absolute.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, that’s impossible. So how do we approach this? How do we answer this question? As a scientist, would you say there is an order which is beyond all human order and disorder?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Science is not able to say anything because any order discovered by science is relative. Not knowing what to do, men have felt the need for the absolute, and not knowing how to get it, they have created the illusion of it in religion and in science or in many other ways.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what shall I do? As a human being who is the totality of human beings, there is order in my life. That order is naturally brought about through insight, and so perhaps it will affect society. Move from that. The enquiry then is, is there an order that is not man-made? Let’s put it that way. I won’t even call it absolute order.</p>
<p>Man has sought a different dimension and perhaps used the word “order.” He has sought a different dimension, because he has understood this dimension. He has lived in it, he has suffered in it, he has gone through all kinds of mess and misery, and he has come to the end of all that. Not just verbally, but he has actually come to the end of all that. You may say there are very few people who do that, but this question must be put.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Would this question have any significance to a person who had not come to the end of that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think it would. Because even if only intellectually he may see the limitations of that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it is important for him to see this even before he has finished with it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How does the mind approach this problem? I think man has struggled to find this out, sir. All so-called religious people - the mystics, the saints, with their illusions - have attempted to grasp this. They have tried to understand something which is not all this. Does it come about through, if I may use the word, “meditation,” as measure?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The original meaning of the word “meditation” is to measure, to ponder, to weigh the value and significance. Perhaps that may have meant that such a measurement would only have significance for seeing that there is disorder.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s what I would say, that measurement can exist only where there is disorder. We are using the word “meditation” not as “measure” or even to “ponder” or “think over,” but as meditation that is the outcome of bringing order in the house and moving from there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So if we see things are in disorder in the mind, then what is meditation?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First the mind must be free of measurement. Otherwise it can’t enter into the other. All <i>effort</i> to bring order into disorder is disorder.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So we are saying that it is the attempt to control that is wrong; we see that it has no meaning. And now we say there’s no control. What do we do?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no, no. If I have an insight into the whole nature of control, which is measure, that liberates the mind from that burden.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Could you explain the nature of this insight, what it means?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Insight is not a movement from knowledge, thought, remembrance, but the cessation of all that, to look at the problem with pure observation, without any pressure, without any motive, to observe the whole movement of measurement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I think we can see that measurement is the same as becoming and the attempt of the mind to measure itself, to control itself, to set itself a goal, is the very source of the disorder.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is the very source of disorder.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In a way that was the wrong way of looking at it, a wrong turning, when man extended measurement from the external sphere into the mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But now the first reaction would be that if we don’t control this thing, it will go wild. That’s what someone might fear.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But, you see, if I have an insight into measurement, that very insight not only banishes all movement of measurement, but there is a different order. It doesn’t go wild; on the contrary.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It does not go wild because it has begun in order. It is really the attempt to measure it that makes it go wild.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s it. The measurement becomes wild; it is confusion.</p>
<p>Now, let’s proceed. After establishing all this, can the mind, through meditation - using the word “meditation” without any sense of measurement, comparison - find an order, a state where there is something that is not man-made? I’ve been through all the man-made things and they are all limited. There is no freedom in them; there is chaos.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>When you say you’ve been through man-made things, what are they?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Religion, worship, prayers, science, anxieties, sorrow, attachment, detachment, loneliness, suffering, confusion, ache - all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Also all the attempts by revolution.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, physical revolution, psychological revolution. Those are all man-made. And also so many people have put this question, and then they say “God.” That is another concept, and that very concept creates disorder.</p>
<p>Now, one has finished with all that. Then the question is, is there something beyond all this that is never touched by human thought, mind?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Now, that makes a difficult point: not touched by the human mind, but mind might go beyond thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s what I want.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Do you mean by the mind only thought, feeling, desire, will, or something much more?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>For the time being we have said the human mind is all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it’s not; the mind is now considered to be limited.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. As long as the human mind is caught in that, it is limited.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the human mind has potential.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Tremendous potential.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which it does not realize now when it is caught in thought, feeling, desire, will, and that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then we’ll say that which is beyond this is not touched by this limited sort of mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p>[<i>Pause</i>]</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now, what will we mean by the mind which is beyond this limit?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First of all, sir, is there such a mind? Is there such a mind that actually, not theoretically or romantically, can say, “I’ve been through this”?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You mean through the limited stuff.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And being through it means finished with it. Is there such a mind? Or does it only think it has finished with it, and therefore it creates the illusion that there is something else? I won’t accept that. A human being, a person, X, says, “I have understood this. I have seen the limitation of all this. I have been through it, and I have come to the end of it. And this mind, having come to the end of it, is no longer the limited mind.” Is there a mind which is totally limitless?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What is the relation between that unlimited mind and the brain?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want to be clear on this point. This mind, brain, the whole of it, the whole nature and the structure of the mind, includes the emotions, the brain, the reactions, physical responses - all that. This mind has lived in turmoil, in chaos, in loneliness, and it has understood all that, has had a profound insight into it. Having such a deep insight cleared the field. This mind is no longer that mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it’s no longer the original limited mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Not only that, no longer the limited mind, the damaged mind. Damaged mind means damaged emotions, damaged brain.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The cells themselves are not in the right order.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. But when there is this insight and therefore order, the damage is undone.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>By reasoning you can see it’s quite possible, because you can say the damage was done by disorderly thoughts and feelings, which overexcite the cells and disrupt them, and now with the insight, that stops and there is a new process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, it’s like a person going for fifty years in a certain direction. If he realizes suddenly that it’s the wrong direction, the whole brain changes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It changes at the core, and then the wrong structure is dismantled and healed. That may take time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But the insight . . .</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is the factor that changes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And that insight does not take time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it means that the whole process has changed the origin.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The limited mind with all its consciousness and its content says it is over. Now, is that mind - which has been limited but has had insight into its limitation and moved away from that limitation - an actuality? Is it then something that is really tremendously revolutionary? And therefore it is no longer the human mind?</p>
<p>When the human mind with its consciousness, which is limited, is ended, then what is the mind?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and what is the person, what is the human being?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is a human being, then? And then what is the relationship between that mind, which is not man-made, and the man-made mind? Can one observe, really, deeply, without any prejudice, whether such a mind exists? Can the mind, conditioned by man, uncondition itself so completely that it’s no longer man-made? Can the man-made mind liberate itself completely from itself?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, of course that’s a somewhat paradoxical statement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course it’s paradoxical; but it’s actual, it is so. Let’s begin again. One can observe that the consciousness of humanity is its content. And its content is all the man-made things - anxiety, fear, and so on. And it is not only the particular, it is the general. Having had an insight into this, it has cleansed itself from that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that implies that it was always potentially more than that, but insight enabled it to be free of that. Is that what you mean?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I won’t say that insight is potential.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is a little difficulty of language if you say the brain or the mind had an insight into its own conditioning, and then you’re almost saying it became something else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I am saying that, I am saying that. The insight transforms the man-made mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but then it’s no longer the man-made mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It’s no longer. That insight means the wiping away of all the content of consciousness. Not bit by bit by bit - the totality of it. And that insight is not the result of man’s endeavour.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but then that seems to raise the question of where it comes from.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right. Where does it come from? Yes. In the brain itself, in the mind itself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which, the brain or the mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Mind - I’m saying the whole of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We say there is mind, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Just a minute, sir. Let’s go slowly. It’s rather interesting. Consciousness is man-made, general and particular. And logically, reasonably one sees the limitations of it. Then the mind has gone much further. Then it comes to a point when it asks, “Can all this be wiped away at one breath, one blow, one movement?” And that movement is insight, the movement of insight. It is still in the mind, but it’s not born of that consciousness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Then you are saying the mind has the possibility, the potential, of moving beyond that consciousness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The brain, mind can do that, but it hasn’t generally done it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Now, having done all this, is there a mind which is not only not man-made but that man cannot conceive, cannot create, that is not an illusion? Is there such a mind?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I think what you are saying is this mind, having freed itself from the general and particular structure of the consciousness of mankind, from its limits, is now much greater. Now, you say that this mind is raising a question.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>This mind is raising the question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which is what?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Which is, first, is that mind free from the man-made mind? That’s the first question.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It may be an illusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Illusion is what I want to get at. One has to be very clear. No, it is not an illusion, because he sees measurement is an illusion; he knows the nature of illusion; that it is born of desire. And illusions must create limitation and so on. He has not only understood it, he’s over it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>He’s free of desire.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Free of desire. That is his nature. I don’t want to put it so brutally. Free of desire.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is full of energy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So this mind, which is no longer general and particular, is therefore not limited; the limitation has been broken down through insight, and therefore the mind is no longer that conditioned mind. Now, then, what is that mind? Being aware that it is no longer caught in illusion?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes; but we were saying it raised a question about whether there is something much greater.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s why I’m raising the question. Is there a mind which is not man-made? And if there is, what is its relationship to the man-made mind?</p>
<p>You see, every form of assertion, every form of verbal statement is not that. So we’re asking if there is a mind which is not man-made. I think that can only be asked when the limitations are ended; otherwise it’s just a foolish question.</p>
<p>So one must be absolutely free of all this. Then only can you put that question. Then you put that question - not “you” - then the question is raised: Is there a mind that is not man-made, and if there is such a mind, what is its relationship to the man-made mind? Now, is there such a mind? Of course there is. Of course, sir. Without being dogmatic or personal, or all that business, there is. But it is not God; we’ve been through all that.</p>
<p>There is. Then the next question is what is the relationship of that to the human mind, man-made mind? Has it any relationship? Has this relationship to that? Obviously not. The man-made mind has no relationship to that. But that has a relationship to this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but not to the illusions in the man-made mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s be clear. My mind is the human mind. It has illusions, desires, and so on. And there is that other mind which has not, which is beyond all limitations. This illusory mind, the man-made mind, is always seeking that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that’s its main trouble.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s its main trouble. It is measuring, it is “progressing,” saying “I am getting nearer, going farther.” And this mind, the human mind, the mind that’s made by human beings, the man-made mind, is always seeking that, and therefore it’s creating more and more mischief, confusion. This man-made mind has no relationship to that.</p>
<p>Now, has that any relationship to this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I was suggesting that it would have to have, but that if we take the illusions which are in the mind, such as desire and fear and so on, it has no relationship to those, because they are figments anyway.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, understood.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But that can have a relationship to the man-made mind in understanding its true structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are you saying, sir, that that mind has a relationship to the human mind the moment it’s moving away from the limitations?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but in understanding those limitations it moves away.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, moves away. Then that has a relationship.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to get the words right. The mind that is not limited, that is not man-made, cannot be related to the illusions that are in the man-made mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. Agreed.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it has to be related to the source, as it were, to the real nature of the man-made mind, which is behind the illusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The man-made mind is based on what?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, on all these things we have said.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, which is its nature. Therefore, how can that have a relationship to this, even basically?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The only relationship is in understanding it, so that some communication would be possible, which might communicate to the other person.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I’m questioning that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, because you were saying that the mind that is not man-made may be related to the limited mind and not the other way round.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I even question that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, all right. You are changing that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I’m just pushing it a little.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It may or may not be so. Is that what you mean by questioning it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I’m questioning it. What is the relationship then of love to jealousy? It has none.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not to jealousy itself, no; that is an illusion, but . . .</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I’m taking two words, say “love” and “hatred.” Love and hatred really have no relationship to each other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, not really. I think that love might understand the origin of hatred, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, yes, yes. I see. You’re saying that love can understand the origin of hatred and how hatred arises. Does love understand that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I think that in some sense it understands its origin in the man-made mind, and that having seen the man-made mind and all its structure and moved away . . .</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are we saying, sir, that love - using that word for the moment - has a relationship to non-love?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Only in the sense of dissolving it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I’m not sure, I’m not sure. We must be awfully careful here. Or the ending of itself . . .</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which is it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>With the ending of hatred, the other is; not the other has relationship to the understanding of hatred.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to ask how it gets started then, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Suppose I have hatred. I can see the origin of it: It’s because you insulted me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s a superficial notion of the origin. Why one behaves so irrationally is the deeper origin. There’s nothing real if you merely insult me, so why should I respond to the insult?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because all my conditioning is that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that’s what I mean by your understanding the origin.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But does love help me to understand the origin of hatred?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, but I think that someone in hatred, moving, understands the origin and moves away.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Moving away, then the other is. The other cannot help the movement away.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, but suppose one human being has this love and another has not. Can the first one communicate something which will start the movement in the second one?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That means A can influence B.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not influence, but, for example, why should anybody be talking about any of this?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s a different matter. No, the question, sir, is, is hate dispelled by love?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or, in the understanding of hatred and the ending of it, the other is?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s right. But say that here in A the other now is, that A has reached that. Love is for A, and he sees B, and we’re asking what he is going to do. You see, that’s the question. What is he going to do?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is the relationship between the two? My wife loves, and I hate. She can talk to me, she can point out to me my unreasonableness, and so on, but her love is not going to transform the source of my hatred.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s clear, yes, except love is the energy which will be behind the talk.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Behind the talk, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The love itself doesn’t sort of go in there and dissolve the hate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course not. That’s romantic.</p>
<p>So the man who hates, who has an insight into the source of it, the cause of it, the movement of it, and ends it, has the other.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. We say A is the one who has seen all this, and he now has the energy to put it to B. It’s up to B what happens.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. I think we had better pursue this.</p>  </section>

<h1>12. The Intelligence of Love</h1>

<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have been saying that a human being who has worked his way through all the problems of life, both physical and psychological, and has really grasped the full significance of freedom from psychological memories and conflicts and travails, comes to a point where the mind finds itself free but hasn’t gathered that supreme energy needed to go beyond itself.</p>
<p>Can the mind, brain, the whole psychological structure, ever be free from all conflict, from all shadow of any disturbance? Or is the idea of complete freedom an illusion?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm:</span>That’s one possibility. Then some people would say we could have partial freedom.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or is the human condition so determined by the past, by its own conditioning, that it can never free itself from it, as some philosophers have stated?</p>
<p>There have been some deeply nonsectarian religious people, totally free from all organized religions and beliefs, rituals, dogmas, who have said it can be done, but very few have said it. Or some say it will take a very long time, that you must go through various lives and suffer all kinds of miseries and ultimately you come to that. But we are not thinking in terms of time. We are asking if a human being - granting, knowing that he is conditioned, deeply, profoundly, so that his whole being is that - can ever free himself. And if he can, what is beyond? That’s what we were coming to.</p>
<p>Would that question be reasonable or valid unless the mind has really finished with all the travail of life? We said our minds are man-made and asked if there is a mind that is not man-made. Is it possible that the man-made mind can free itself from its own man-made mechanical mind? How shall we find this out?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There’s a difficult thing to express here. If this mind is totally man-made, totally conditioned, then in what sense can it get out of it? If you say that it had at least the possibility of something beyond . . .</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then it becomes a reward, a temptation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Logically it may appear to be inconsistent to say that the mind is totally conditioned and yet it’s going to get out.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If one admits that there is a part that is not conditioned, then we enter into quite another thing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That may be another inconsistency.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. We have been saying that the mind, although deeply conditioned, can free itself through insight. That is the real clue to this. Would you agree to that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We went into what the nature of insight is. Can insight uncondition the mind completely and wipe away completely all the illusions, all the desires? Or is it partial?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If we say the mind is totally conditioned, it suggests something static, which would never change. Now, if we say the mind is always in movement, then it seems in some way it becomes impossible to say what it is at this moment. We couldn’t say it has been totally conditioned.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, let’s say I’m totally conditioned; it’s in movement, but the movement is within a border, within a certain field. And the field is very definitely marked out. The mind can expand it and contract it, but the boundary is very, very limited, definite. Now, it is always moving within that limitation. Can it die away from that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s the point; that’s another kind of movement. It’s kind of in another dimension, I think you’ve said.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. And we say it is possible through insight, which is also a movement, a totally different kind of movement.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but then we say <i>that</i> movement does not originate in the individual nor in the general mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. It is not the insight of the particular or the general. We are then stating something quite outrageous.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That rather violates most of the sort of logic that people use. Either the particular or the general should cover everything, in terms of ordinary logic.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now, if you’re saying there’s something beyond both, this is already a question which has not been stated, and I think it has great importance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How do we then state it, or how do we then come to it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>People divide themselves roughly into two groups. One group feels the ground is the concrete, particular daily activity. The other group feels that the general, the universal, is the ground. One is the more practical type, and the other the more philosophical type. In general, this division has been visible throughout history and also in everyday life, wherever you look.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But, sir, is the general separate from the particular?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It’s not. Most people agree with that, but people tend to give emphasis to one or the other. Some give emphasis to the particular, saying the general is there but if you take care of the particular the general will be all right. The others say the general is the main thing, the universal, and by getting that right you’ll get the particular right. So there’s been a kind of imbalance to one side or the other, a bias in the mind of man. What’s being raised here is the notion that it is neither the general nor the particular.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. That’s just it. Can we discuss it logically? Using your expertise, your scientific brain and this man who is not all that, can we have a conversation to find out if the general and particular are one, not divided at all?</p>
<p>So where are we now? We are neither the particular nor the general. That’s a statement that can hardly be accepted reasonably.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it’s reasonable if you take thought to be a movement rather than a content. Then thought is the movement between the particular and the general.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Thought is a movement. Quite; we agree to that. But thought is the general and thought is the particular.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Thought is also the movement. In the movement it goes beyond being one or the other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Does it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it can. Ordinarily it does not, because ordinarily thought is caught on one side or the other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s the whole point, isn’t it? Ordinarily the general and the particular are in the same area.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and you fix on one or the other.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but in the same area, in the same field. And thought is the movement between the two. Thought has created both.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it has created both and moves between.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, between and around and in that area. And it has been doing this for millennia.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and most people would feel that’s all it can do.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Now we are saying that, when thought ends, that movement which thought has created also comes to an end. Therefore time comes to an end.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We should go more slowly here, because you see it’s a jump from thought to time. We’ve gone into it before, but it’s still a jump.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Sorry. Right. Let’s see. Thought has created the general and the particular, and thought is a movement that connects the two. Thought moves round it, so it is still in the same area.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and doing that it has created time, which is part of the general and the particular. Time is a particular time and also a general time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but you see, thought is time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that’s another question. We have said that thought has a content which is about time, and that thought is a movement which is time. It could be said to be moving from the past into the future.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But, sir, thought is based on time, thought is the outcome of time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but then does that mean that time exists beyond thought? If you say thought is based on time, then time is more fundamental than thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to go into that. You could say that time is something which was there before thought, or at least is at the origin of thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Time is there when there is the accumulation of knowledge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that has come out of thought to some extent.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I act and learn. That action is not based on previous knowledge, but I do something, and in the doing I learn.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Then that learning is registered in the memory.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So is not thought essentially the movement of time?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to say in what sense this learning is the movement of time. You can say that when we learn, it is registered, and then that what you have learned operates in the next experience.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. The past is always moving to the present.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and mixing, fusing with the present. And the two together are again registered as the next experience.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So are we saying time is different from thought, or time is thought?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We are saying this movement of learning, and the response of memory into experience and then registering, is time, and that is also thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is thought. Is there a time apart from thought?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s another question. Would we say that physically or in the cosmos time has a significance apart from thought?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Physically, yes, I understand that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So then we’re saying in the mind or psychologically.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Psychologically. As long as there is psychological accumulation as knowledge, as the “me,” and so on, there is time. It is based on time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Wherever there is accumulation, there is time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s the point. Wherever there is accumulation, there is time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which turns the thing around, because usually you say time is first and in time you accumulate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I would put it round the other way, personally.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. But it’s important to see that it’s put the other way. Then we’d say, suppose there is no accumulation? Then what?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then - that’s the whole point - there is no time. As long as I am accumulating, gathering, becoming, there is the process of time. But if there is no gathering, no becoming, no accumulation, where does psychological time exist? So thought is the outcome of psychological accumulation, and that accumulation, that gathering, gives it a sense of continuity, which is time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems it’s in movement. Whatever has been accumulated is responding to the present, with the projection of the future, and then that is again registered. Now, the accumulation of all that’s registered is in the order of time - one time, the next time, and so on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. So we’re saying thought is time. Psychological accumulation is thought and time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We’re saying that we happen to have two words when really we only need one.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>One word. That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because we have two words, we look for two things.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. There is only one movement, which is time and thought, time plus thought, or time/thought. Now, can the mind, which has moved for millennia in that area, free itself from that?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Now, why is the mind bound up? Let’s see exactly what’s holding the mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Accumulation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but why does the mind continue to accumulate?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because in accumulation there is apparent safety, there is apparent security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The accumulation of physical food may provide a certain kind of security. And then since no distinction was made between the outer and the inner, there was the feeling that one could accumulate inwardly either experiences or some knowledge of what to do.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are we saying the outward physical accumulation is necessary for security, and that same movement, same idea, same urge, moves into the field of the psychological, so we accumulate there, hoping to be secure?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, inwardly hoping to accumulate present memories or relationships or things you could count on, principles you could count on.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So psychological accumulation is the illusion of safety, protection, security?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. It does seem that the first mistake was that man never understood the distinction between what he has to do outside and what he has to do inside.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is the same movement, outer and inner.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The movement that was right outwardly man carried inward, without knowing that that would make trouble.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So where are we now? A human being realizes all this, has come to the point when he says, “Can I really be free from this accumulated security and thought and psychological time?” Is that possible?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, if we say that it had this origin, then it should be possible to dismantle it, but, if it were built into us, nothing could be done.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course not. It is not built into us.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Most people act as though they believe it was.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, that’s absurd.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If it’s not built into us, then the possibility exists for us to change. Because in some way it was built up in the first place through time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If we say it is built in, then we are in a hopeless state.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and I think that’s one of the difficulties of people who use evolution. They’re hoping by bringing in evolution to get out of this static boundary. They don’t realize that evolution is the same thing, or that it’s even worse, it’s the very means by which the trap was made.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So as a human being, I have come to that point. I realize all this. I’m fully aware of the nature of this. And my next question is can this mind move on from this field altogether and enter, perhaps, into a totally different dimension? And we said it can only happen when there is insight.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems that insight arises when one questions this whole thing very deeply and sees it doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Now, having had insight into this and seen its limitation, and looking beyond it - what is there beyond?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It’s very difficult to even bring this into words, but we said something has to be done on this line.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I think it has to be put into words.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Could you say why? Because many people might feel we should leave this entirely nonverbal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can we say the word is not the thing? Whatever the description, it is not the real, not the truth, however much you embellish or diminish it. We recognize that the word is not that, then what is there beyond all this? Can my mind be so desireless that it won’t create an illusion, something beyond?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then it’s a question of desire; desire must be in this time process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Desire is time. Being, becoming, is based on desire.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They are one and the same, really.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, one and the same. Now, when one has an insight into that whole movement of desire and its capacity to create illusion, it’s finished.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Since this is a very crucial point, we should try to say a little more about desire: how it’s intrinsic in the accumulating process, how it comes out in many different ways. For one thing you could say that as you accumulate, there comes a sense of something missing. You feel you should have more, something to complete it. Whatever you have accumulated is not complete.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Could we go into the question of becoming, first? Why is it that all human beings have this urge to become? We can understand it outwardly, simply enough. Physically, you develop a muscle to make it stronger. You can find a better job, have more comfort, and so on. But why is there this need in the human mind to try to become enlightened - let’s use that word for the moment - trying to become more good, better?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There must be a sense of dissatisfaction with what’s there already. A person feels he would like to be complete. Suppose, for example, he has accumulated memories of pleasure, but these memories are no longer adequate and he feels something more is needed.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it dissatisfaction? Is that it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, wanting to get more. Eventually he feels that he must have the whole, the ultimate.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I’m not at all sure whether the word “more” is not the real thorn. More: I will be more; I will have more; I will become; this whole movement of moving forward, gaining, comparing, advancing, achieving - psychologically.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The word “more” is just implicit in the whole meaning of the word “accumulate.” So if you’re accumulating, you have to be accumulating more. There’s no other way to do it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So why is there this need in the human mind?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we didn’t see that this “more” is wrong, inwardly. If we started outwardly to use the term “more,” but then carried it inward, for some reason we didn’t see how destructive it was.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why? Why haven’t fairly intelligent philosophers and religious people, who have spent a great part of their lives achieving, seen this very simple thing? Why haven’t the intellectuals seen the simple fact that where there is accumulation there must be more?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They’ve seen that but they don’t see any harm in it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I’m not sure they see it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They are trying to get more, so they say, “We are trying to have a better life.” For example, the nineteenth century was the “century of progress.” Men were improving all the time.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Outward progress.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But they felt that man would be improving himself inwardly too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But why haven’t they ever questioned this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What would make them question it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>This constant struggle for the more.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They thought that was necessary for progress.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But is that progress? Has that same outward urge to be better moved into the psychological realm?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Can we make it clear why it does harm in the psychological realm?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s think it out. What is the harm in accumulating, psychologically? Oh, yes, it divides.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What does it divide?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The very nature of accumulation brings about a division between you and me and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Could we make that clear, because it is a crucial point? I can see that you are accumulating in your way and I accumulate in my way. Then we try to impose a common way of accumulating and that’s conflict. They say everybody should be “more.”</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is impossible. That never takes place. I have accumulated psychologically as a Hindu; another has accumulated as a Muslim. There are thousands of divisions. Therefore accumulation in its very nature divides people, and therefore creates conflict.</p>
<p>So can we say, then, that in accumulation man has sought psychological security, and that security with its accumulation is the factor of human division psychologically? That’s why human beings have accumulated, not realizing its consequences. Realizing that, is it possible not to accumulate?</p>
<p>Suppose my mind is filled with this process of accumulation, which is psychological knowledge. Can all that end? Of course it can.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If the mind can get to the root of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course it can. It sees that it is an illusion that in accumulation there is security.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But we are saying that desire is what keeps people going on with it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Not only desire but this deep-rooted instinct to accumulate, for the future, for safety. That and desire go together. So desire plus accumulation is the factor of division, conflict. Now, I’m asking, can that end? If it ends through an action of will, it is still the same thing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s part of desire.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. If it ends because of punishment or reward, it’s still the same thing. So the mind, one’s mind, sees this and puts all that aside. But does the mind become free of accumulation? Yes, sir, I think it can; that is, have no psychological knowledge as accumulation at all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, I think that we have to consider that knowledge goes very much further than is ordinarily meant. For example, if you’re getting knowledge of a microphone, you build up an image, a picture of the microphone and everything goes into that and one expects it to continue. So if you have knowledge of yourself, it builds up a picture of yourself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can one have knowledge of oneself?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, but if you think you have, if you think that there is knowledge about what sort of person you are, that builds up into a picture, with the expectations.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But, after all, if you have knowledge of yourself, you have built an image already. But once you realize psychological accumulation as knowledge is an illusion and destructive and causes infinite pain and misery, it is finished.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I know certain things in knowledge, and that it’s foolish to have that kind of knowledge about myself, but then there may be other kinds of knowledge which I don’t recognize as knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What kind, what other kinds of knowledge does one have? Preferences, likes and dislikes, prejudices, habits - all that is in the image that one has created.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Now, man has developed in such a way that that image seems extraordinarily real, and therefore its qualities don’t seem to be knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right, sir. So we have said accumulation is time and accumulation is security, and where there is psychological accumulation there must be division. And thought is the movement between the particular and the general, and thought is also born out of the image of what has been accumulated. All that is one’s inward state. That is deeply embedded in me. I recognize it is somewhat necessary physically. But how do I set about realizing that psychologically it is not? How do I, who have had the habit of accumulating for millennia, general and particular, not only recognize the habit, but when I do recognize the habit, how does that movement come to an end? That is the real question.</p>
<p>Where does intelligence play a part in all this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There has to be intelligence to see this.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is it intelligence? Is it so-called ordinary intelligence or some other intelligence, something entirely different?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I don’t know what people mean by intelligence, but if they mean just merely the capacity to . . .</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To discern, to distinguish, to solve technical problems, economic problems, and so on. I would call that partial intelligence because it is not really . . .</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, call that “skill in thought.”</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right, skill in thought. Now, wait a minute. That’s what I’m trying to find out. I realize the reason for accumulation, division, security, the general and particular, thought. I can see the logic of all that. But logic, reason, and explanation don’t end the thing. Another quality is necessary. Is that quality intelligence? I’m trying to move away from “insight” for a while. Is intelligence associated with thought? Is it related, is it part of thought, is it the outcome of very clear, precise, exact, logical conclusions of thought?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That would still be more and more skill.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, skill.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but when we say intelligence, at least we suggest the intelligence has a different quality.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Is that intelligence related to love?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I’d say they go together.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, I’m just moving slowly to that. You see, I’ve realized all that we have discussed, and I’ve come to a blank wall, a solid wall that I can’t go beyond. And in observing, looking, fishing around, I come upon this word “intelligence.” And I see that the so-called intelligence of thought, skill, is not intelligence. So I’m asking further if this intelligence is associated with or related to or part of love. One cannot accumulate love.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>No, people might try. People do try to guarantee love.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It sounds silly! That is all romantic nonsense, cinema stuff. You cannot accumulate love. You cannot associate it with hate. That love is something entirely different. And has that love intelligence? Which then operates? Which then breaks down the wall?</p>
<p>All right, sir, let’s begin again. I don’t know what that love is. I know all the physical bit. I realize pleasure, desire, accumulation, remembrance, images, are not love. I realized all that long ago. But I’ve come to the point where this wall is so enormous that I can’t even jump over it. So I’m now fishing around to see if there is a different movement which is not a man-made movement. And that movement may be love. I’m sorry to use that word because it has been so spoilt and misused, but we’ll use it for the time being.</p>
<p>So is that love, with its intelligence, the factor that will break down or dissolve or break up this wall? Not “I love you” or “you love me.” It’s not personal or particular. It’s not general or particular. It is something beyond. I think when one loves with that intelligence, it covers the whole; it’s not the particular or general. It is that. It is light; it’s not particular light. If that is the factor that will break down the wall that is in front of me, then I don’t know that love. As a human being, having reached a certain point, I can’t go beyond it to find that love. What shall I do? Not “do” or “not do,” but what is the state of my mind when I realize that any movement this side of the wall is still strengthening the wall? I realize, through meditation or whatever you do, that there is no movement, but the mind can’t go beyond it.</p>
<p>But you come along and say, “Look, that wall can be dissolved, broken down, if you have that quality of love with intelligence.” And I say, “Excellent, but I don’t know what it is.” What shall I do? I can’t do anything; I realize that. Whatever I do is still on this side of the wall.</p>
<p>So am I in despair? Obviously not, because if I am in despair or depressed, I’m still moving in the same field. So all that has stopped. Realizing that I cannot possibly do anything, make any movement, what takes place in my mind? I realize I cannot do a thing. So what has happened to the quality of my mind, which has always moved to accumulate, to become? All that has stopped. The moment I realize this, no movement. Is that possible? Or am I living in illusion? Or have I really gone through all this to come to that point? Or do I suddenly say, I must be quiet?</p>
<p>Is there a revolution in my mind, a revolution in the sense that movement has completely stopped? And if it has, is love something beyond the wall?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it wouldn’t mean anything.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, it couldn’t be.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The wall itself is the product of the process which is illusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Exactly. I’m realizing that the wall <i>is</i> this movement. So when this movement ends, that quality of intelligence, love and so on, is there. That’s the whole point.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Could one say the movement ends, the movement sees that it has no point?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is like the so-called skill to see a danger.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it could be.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. Any danger demands a certain amount of awareness. But I have never realized as a human being that the accumulating process is a tremendous danger.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because that seems to be the essence of security.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. You come along and point it out to me, and I’m listening to you very carefully and I see, and I actually perceive the danger of that. And perception is part of love, isn’t it? So the very perception, without any motive, without any direction, of the wall - which has been brought into being by this movement of accumulation - <i>is</i> intelligence and love.</p>

<h1>13. The Ending of ‘Psychological’ Knowledge</h1>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What makes the mind always follow a certain pattern? Always seeking? If it lets go of one pattern it picks up another; it keeps on functioning all the time like that. One can give explanations of why it does so - for protection, for safety, from indifference, a certain amount of callousness, a disregard of one’s own flowering, etc.</p>
<p>But it is really very important to explore deeply why our minds are always operating in a certain direction.</p>
<p>We said that one comes, after going through travail, investigation, and insight, to a blank wall. And that blank wall can only wither away, or be broken down, when there is love and intelligence. Before we go into that, I would like to ask why human beings, however intelligent, however learned, however philosophical and religious, always fall into this groove of pattern seeking.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>Well, I think the groove is inherent in the nature of the accumulated knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are you saying then that knowledge must invariably create a groove?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps it is not inevitable but it seems to develop this way in mankind, if we are referring to psychological knowledge, that is to say...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously we are talking of that. But why does the mind not become aware of it - see the danger of this mechanical repetition, and the fact that there is nothing new in it? See how we keep on doing it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems to me that the groove, or the accumulated knowledge, seems to have a significance far beyond what its significance is. If we say that we have knowledge of some object, like the microphone, that has some limited significance. But knowledge about the nation to which you belong seems to have immense significance.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. So is this attribution of significance the cause of the narrowing down of the mind?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because this knowledge seems to have a tremendous value beyond all other values, it makes the mind stick to that. It seems the most important thing in the world.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In India, there is this philosophy that knowledge must end - you know it, of course, the Vedanta. But apparently very, very few people do end knowledge and talk from freedom.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, knowledge generally seems to be extremely important, even when a person may say verbally that it should end...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You mean I am so stupid that I don’t see that this psychological knowledge has very little significance, and so my mind clings to it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I wouldn’t quite put it that a person is that stupid, but rather say that his knowledge stupefies the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Stupefied, all right. But the brain doesn’t seem to extricate itself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is already so stupefied that it can’t see what it is doing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what shall it do? I have been watching for many years people attempting to become free from certain things. This is the root of it, you understand? This psychological accumulation which becomes psychological knowledge. And so it divides, and all kinds of things happen around it and within it. And yet the mind refuses to let go.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why? Is that because there is safety or security in it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is part of it, but I think in some way that knowledge has taken on the significance of the absolute, instead of being relative.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand all that, but you are not answering my question. I am an ordinary man, I realize all this, and the limited significance of knowledge at different levels, but deeper down inside one, this accumulated knowledge is very destructive.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The knowledge deceives the mind, so that the person is not normally aware that it is destructive. Once this process gets started, the mind is not in a state where it is able to look at it because it is avoiding the question. There is a tremendous defensive mechanism or escape from looking at the whole issue.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because it seems that something extremely precious might be at stake.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>One is strangely intelligent, capable or skilled in other directions, but here, where the root is of all this trouble, why don’t we comprehend what is happening? What prevents the mind from doing this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Once importance has been given to knowledge, there is a mechanical process that resists intelligence.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what shall I do? I realize I must let go the accumulated, psychological knowledge - which is divisive, destructive and petty - but I can’t. Is this because of lack of energy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not primarily, though the energy is being dissipated by the process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Having dissipated a great deal of energy, I haven’t the energy to grapple with this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The energy would come back quickly if we could understand this. I don’t think that is the main point.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. So what shall I do, realizing that this knowledge is inevitably forming a groove in which I live? How am I to break it down?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I am not sure that it is generally clear to people that this knowledge does all that; or that the knowledge is knowledge. You see, it may seem to be some ‘being’, the ‘self’, and ‘me’. This knowledge creates the ‘me’, and the ‘me’ is the experience as an entity, which seems not to be knowledge but some real being.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Are you saying that this ‘being’ is different from knowledge?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It appears to be; it feigns a difference.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But is it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It isn’t, but the illusion has great power.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That has been our conditioning.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Now the question is, how do we get through that to break down the groove, because it creates the imitation, or a pretension, of a state of being?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is the real point, you see. This is man’s central movement. It seems so utterly hopeless. And realizing the hopelessness I sit down and say I can’t do anything. But if I apply my mind to it, the question arises, is it possible to function without psychological knowledge in this world? I am rather concerned about it; it seems the basic issue that man must resolve, all over the world.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is right. But you may discuss with somebody, who thinks it seems reasonable. But perhaps his status is threatened, and we have to say that that is psychological knowledge. It doesn’t seem to him that it is knowledge, but something more. And he doesn’t see that his knowledge of his status is behind the trouble. At first sight knowledge seems to be something passive, which you could use if you wanted to, and which you could just put aside if you wished, which is the way it should be.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I understand all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But then the moment comes when knowledge no longer appears to be knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The politicians and the people in power wouldn’t listen to this. And neither would the so-called religious people. It is only the people who are discontented, who feel they have lost everything, who will listen. But they don’t always listen so that it is a real burning thing.</p>
<p>How does one go about this? Say, for instance, I have left Catholicism and Protestantism, and all that. Also I have a career and I know that it is necessary to have knowledge there. Now I see how important it is not to be caught in the process of psychological knowledge, and yet I can’t let it go. It is always dodging me; I am playing tricks with it. It is like hide and seek. All right! We said that is the wall I have to break down. No, not I - that is the wall that has to be broken down. And we have said that this wall can be broken down through love and intelligence. Aren’t we asking something enormously difficult?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is difficult.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am this side of the wall, and you are asking me to have that love and intelligence which will destroy it. But I don’t know what that love is, what that intelligence is, because I am caught in this, on this other side of the wall. I realize logically, sanely, that what you are saying is accurate, true, logical, and I see the importance of it, but the wall is so strong and dominant and powerful that I can’t get beyond it. We said the other day that the wall could be broken down through insight - if insight does not become translated into an idea.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>When insight is discussed, there is the danger of our making an abstraction of it; which means we move away from the fact, and the abstraction becomes all important. Which means, again, knowledge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the activity of knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So we are back again!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think the general difficulty is that knowledge is not just sitting there as a form of information, but is extremely active, meeting and shaping every moment according to past knowledge. So even when we raise this issue, knowledge is all the time waiting, and then acting. Our whole tradition is that knowledge is not active but passive. But it is really active, although people don’t generally think of it that way. They think it is just sitting there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is waiting.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Waiting to act, you see. And whatever we try to do about it, knowledge is already acting. By the time we realize that this is the problem, it has already acted.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But do I realize it as a problem, or as an idea which I must carry out? You see the difference?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Knowledge automatically turns everything into an idea, which we must carry out. That is the whole way it is built.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The whole way we have lived.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Knowledge can’t do anything else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How are we to break that, even for a second?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems to me that if you could see, observe, be aware - if knowledge could be aware of itself at work... The point is that knowledge seems to work unawares, simply waiting, and then acting, by which time it has disrupted the order of the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am very concerned about this because wherever I go this is what is happening. It is something that has to be resolved. Would you say the capacity to listen is far more important than any of this, than any explanations, or logic?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It comes to the same problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, no. It doesn’t. I want to see if there is a possibility that when I listen completely to what you are saying, the wall has broken down. You understand? Is there - I am trying to find out, Sir - I am an ordinary man and you are telling me all this, and I realize what you are saying is so. I am really deeply involved in what you are saying, but somehow the flame isn’t lit; all the fuel is there, but the fire is not. So what shall I do? This is my everlasting cry!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The brain has the capacity to listen; we have to question whether the ordinary man is so full of opinions that he can’t listen.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You can’t listen with opinions; you might just as well be dead.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think knowledge has all sorts of defences. Is it possible for, say, the ordinary man to have this perception? That is really what you are asking, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But there must be a communication between you and that man, something so strong that the very act of his listening to you, and you communicating with him, operates.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, then you have to break through his opinions, through the whole structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. That is why this man has come here - for that. He has finished with all the churches and doctrines. He realizes that what has been said here is true. When you communicate with him, your communication is strong and real, because you are not speaking from knowledge or opinions. A free human being is trying to communicate with this ordinary man. Now can he listen with that intensity which you, the communicator, are giving him? He wants to listen to somebody who is telling the truth, and in the very telling of it, something is taking place in him. Because he is so ardently listening, this happens.</p>
<p>It is rather like you as a scientist, telling one of your students something. You are telling him about something which must be enormously important, because you have given your life to it. And the student has given up much just to come here. Is it the fault of the communicator that the listener does not receive it instantly? Or is the listener incapable of hearing it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, if he is incapable of listening, then nothing can be done. But let’s say there is somebody who comes along who has got through some of these defences, although there are others that he is not aware of - that is something less simple than what you have described.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I feel it is dreadfully simple somehow. If one could listen with all one’s being, the brain would not be caught in the groove. You see, generally, in communication, you are telling me something and I am absorbing it, but there is an interval between you telling and my absorbing.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And that interval is the danger. If I don’t absolutely absorb, listen with all my being, it is finished. Is listening difficult because in this there is no shadow of pleasure? You are not offering any pleasure, any gratification. You are saying this is so; take it. But my mind is so involved in pleasure that it won’t listen to anything that is not completely satisfactory or pleasurable.</p>
<p>I realize too the danger of that. Of seeking satisfaction and pleasure, so I put that aside too. There is no pleasure, no reward, no punishment. In listening, there is only pure observation.</p>
<p>So we come to the point, is pure observation, which is actually listening, love? I think it is.</p>
<p>Again, if you state this, then my mind says ‘Give it to me. Tell me what to do.’ But when I ask you to tell me what to do, I am back in the field of knowledge. It is so instantaneous. So I refuse to ask you what to do. Then where am I? You have referred to perception without any motive or direction. Pure perception is love. And in that perception love is intelligence. They are not three separate things, they are all one thing. You pointed all this out very carefully, step by step, and I have come to that point that I have a feeling for it. But it goes away so quickly. Then the question begins, ‘How am I to get it back?’ Again, the remembrance of it, which is knowledge, blocks.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What you are saying is that every time there is a communication, knowledge begins to work in many different forms.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So you see it is enormously difficult to be free of knowledge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We could ask, why doesn’t knowledge wait until it is needed?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That means to be psychologically free of knowledge, but, when the need arises, to act from freedom, not from knowledge.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But knowledge comes in to inform your action, although it is not the source.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is freedom from knowledge. And being free, it is from freedom and not from knowledge that one communicates. That is, from emptiness there is communication. When we use words, they are the outcome of knowledge, but they are from that state of complete freedom. Now, suppose I, as an ordinary human being, have come to that point where there is this freedom, and from it communication takes place - will you, as an eminent scientist, communicate with me without any barrier? You follow what I am saying?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. There is this freedom from knowledge when knowledge is seen to be information. But ordinarily it seems more than information, and knowledge itself does not see that knowledge is not free.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is never free. And if I am going to understand myself, I must be free to look.</p>
<p>How will you communicate with me, who have come to a certain point where I am burning to receive what you are saying, so completely that psychological knowledge is finished? Or am I fooling myself about being in that state?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that is the question: knowledge is constantly deceiving itself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So is my mind always deceiving itself? Then what shall I do? Let’s come back to that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Again I think the answer is to listen.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Why don’t we listen? Why don’t we immediately understand this thing? One can give all the superficial reasons why - old age, conditioning, laziness, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But is it possible to give the deep reason for it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think it is that the knowledge which is the ‘me’ is so tremendously strong as an idea.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is why I tried to say that the idea has tremendous significance and meaning. For example, suppose you have the idea of God; this takes on a tremendous power.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or if I have the idea that I am British, or French, it gives me great energy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And so it creates a state of the body which seems the very being of the self. Now the person doesn’t experience it as mere knowledge...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but are we going round and round and round? It seems like it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I was wondering if there is anything that could be communicated about that overwhelming power that seems to come with knowledge...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...and with identification.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That seems to be something that would be worth looking into.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now what is the root meaning of ‘identification’?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Always the same.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Always the same, that’s right. That’s right! There is nothing new under the sun.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You say the self is always the same. It tries to be always the same in essence, if not in detail.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think this is the thing that goes wrong with knowledge. It attempts to be involved with what is always the same, so it sticks, you see. Knowledge itself tries to find what is permanent and perfect. I mean, even independent of any of us. It is like building it into the cells.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>From this arises the question, is it possible to attend diligently? I am using ‘diligence’ in the sense of being accurate.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Actually it means to take pains.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. To take pains, take the whole of it. There must be some other way round all this intellectual business. We have exercised a great deal of it and that intellectual capacity has led to the blank wall. I approach it from every direction, but eventually the wall is there, which is the ‘me’, with my knowledge, my prejudice, and all the rest of it. And the ‘me’ then says, ‘I must do something about it.’ Which is still the ‘me’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The ‘me’ wants always to be constant, but at the same time it tries to change.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To put on a different coat. It is always the same. So the mind which is functioning with the ‘me’ is always the same mind. Good Lord, you see, we are back again!</p>
<p>We have tried everything - fasting, every kind of discipline - to get rid of the ‘me’ with all its knowledge and illusions. One tries to identify with something else, which is the same thing. One then comes back to the fundamental question, what will make the blank wall totally disappear? I think this is only possible when the man who is blocked can give total attention to what the free man is saying. There is no other means to break down the wall - not the intellect, not the emotions, nor anything else. When somebody who has gone beyond the wall, who has broken it down, says, ‘Listen, for God’s sake listen,’ and I listen to him with my mind empty, then it is finished. You know what I am saying? I have no sense of hoping for anything to happen, or anything to come back, or concern with the future. The mind is empty, and therefore listening. It is finished.</p>
<p>For a scientist to discover something new, he must have a certain emptiness from which there will be a different perception.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but only in the sense that usually the question is limited, and so the mind may be empty with regard to that particular question, allowing the discovery of an insight in that area. But we are not questioning this particular area. We are questioning the whole of knowledge.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is most extraordinary when you go into it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And you were saying the end of knowledge is the Vedanta.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is the real answer.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But generally people feel they must keep knowledge in one area to be able to question it in another. You see it might worry people to ask, with what knowledge do I question the whole of knowledge?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. With what knowledge do I question my knowledge? Quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In a way, we do have knowledge, because we have seen that this whole structure of psychological knowledge makes no sense, that it is inconsistent and has no meaning.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>From that emptiness that we were talking of, is there a ground or a source from which all things begin? Matter, human beings, their capacities, their idiocies - does the whole movement start from there?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We could consider that. But let’s try to clarify it a little. We have the emptiness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, emptiness in which there is no movement of thought as psychological knowledge. And therefore no psychological time.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Though we still have the time of the watch...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but we have gone beyond that; don’t let’s go back to it. There is no psychological time, no movement of thought. And is that emptiness the beginning of all movement?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, would you say the emptiness is the ground?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I am asking. Let’s go slowly into this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Earlier on, we were saying that there is the emptiness, and beyond that is the ground.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know, I know. Let’s discuss this further.</p>
<p class="right">18 September 1980, Brockwood Park, Hampshire</p>


<h1>14. The Mind in the Universe</h1>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We talked the other day about a mind that is entirely free from all movement, from all the things that thought has put there, the past, and the future, and so on. But before we go into that I would like to discuss man’s being caught in materialistic attitudes and values, and to ask, what is the nature of materialism?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>Well, first of all materialism is the name of a certain philosophical...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t mean that. I want to explore this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Matter is all there is, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is, nature and all human beings, react physically. This reaction is sustained by thought. And thought is a material process. So reaction in nature is a materialistic response.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think the word ‘materialistic’ is not quite right. It is the response of matter.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The response of matter; let’s put it that way. That is better. We are talking about having an empty mind, and we have come to that point when the wall has been broken down. This emptiness and what lies beyond it, or through it - we will come to that, but before doing so, I am asking, is all reaction matter?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Matter in movement. You could say that there is evidence in favour of that, that science has found a tremendous number of reactions which are due to the nerves.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So would you say that matter and movement are the reactions which exist in all organic matter?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, all matter as we know it goes by the law of action and reaction, you see. Every action has a corresponding reaction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So action and reaction are a material process, as is thought. Now, to go beyond it is the issue.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But before we say that, some people might feel that there is no meaning in going beyond it. That would be the philosophy of materialism.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But if one is merely living in that area it is very, very shallow. Right? It has really no meaning at all.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps one should refer to one thing that people have said - that matter is not merely action and reaction, but may have a creative movement. You see, matter may create new forms.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it is still in that area.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Let’s try to make it clear. We have to see that there are very subtle forms of materialism which might be difficult to pin down.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s begin. Would you consider that thought is a material process?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Well, some people might argue that it is both material, and something beyond material.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know. I have discussed this. But it is not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>How can we say that simply, to make it clear?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because any movement of thought is a material process.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we have to amplify this so that it is not a matter of authority. As an observation, one sees that thought is a material process. Now how are you going to see that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How could one be aware that thought is a material process? I think that is fairly clear. There is an experience, an incident which is recorded, which becomes knowledge. And from that knowledge, thought arises and action takes place.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. So we say that thought is that. It is still coming from the background. So are you saying that something new coming into being is not part of this process?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, if there is to be something new, thought, as a material process, must end. Obviously.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And then it may take it up later.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Later, yes. Wait, see what happens later. So we say all action, reaction and action from that reaction is movement of matter.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, very subtle movement of matter.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So as long as one’s mind is within that area, it must be a movement of matter. So is it possible for the mind to go beyond reaction? That is the next step. As we said earlier one gets irritated, and that is the first reaction. Then the reaction to that, the second reaction, is ‘I must not be’. Then the third reaction is, ‘I must control or justify’. So it is constantly action and reaction. Can one see that this is a continuous movement without an ending?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. The reaction is continuous, but it seems at a certain moment to have ended, and the next moment appears to be a new movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it is still reaction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is still the same but it presents itself differently.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is exactly the same always...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it presents itself as always different, always new.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. That’s just it. You say something, I get irritated, but that irritation is a reaction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it seems to be something suddenly new.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it is not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But one has to be aware of that, you see. Generally the mind tends not to be aware of it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are sensitive to it, alert to the question. So there is an ending to reaction if one is watchful, attentive; if one understands not only logically, but having an insight into this reacting process, it can of course come to an end. That is why it is very important to understand this, before we discuss what is an empty mind, and if there is something beyond this, or whether in that very emptying of the mind there is some other quality.</p>
<p>So is that empty mind a reaction? A reaction to the problems of pain and pleasure and suffering? An attempt to escape from all this into some state of nothingness?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, the mind can always do that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It can invent. Now we have come to the point of asking whether this quality of emptiness is not a reaction. Right, Sir? Before we go further, is it possible to have a mind that is really completely empty of all the things that thought has put together?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So that thought ceases to act.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>On the one hand, perhaps you could say that reaction is due to the nature of matter, which is continually reacting and moving. But then is matter affected by this insight?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t quite follow. Ah, I understand! Does insight affect the cells of the brain which contain the memory?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. The memory is continually reacting, moving, as does the air and the water, and everything around us.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>After all, if I don’t react physically I am paralysed. But to be reacting continuously is also a form of paralysis.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, the wrong kind of reaction! Reaction around the psychological structure. But assuming that the reaction around the psychological structure has begun in mankind, why should it ever stop? Because reaction makes another and another, and one would expect it to go on for ever, and that nothing would stop it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Only insight into the nature of reaction ends psychological reaction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then you are saying that matter is affected by insight which is beyond matter.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, beyond matter. So is this emptiness within the brain itself? Or is it something that thought has conceived as being empty? One must be very clear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. But whatever we discuss, no matter what the question is, thought begins to want to do something about it, because thought feels it can always make a contribution.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Thought in the past did not understand that it has no useful contribution to make, but it has kept on in the habit of trying to say that emptiness is very good. Therefore thought says, I will try to bring about the emptiness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Thought is trying to be helpful!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have been through all that. We have seen the nature of thought, and its movement, time, and all that. But I want to find out whether this emptiness is within the mind itself, or beyond it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What do you mean by the mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The mind is the whole - emotions, thought, consciousness, the brain - the whole of that is the mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The word ‘mind’ has been used in many ways. Now you are using it in a certain way, that it represents thought, feeling, desire and will - the whole material process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, the whole material process.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which people have called non-material!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. But the mind is the whole material process.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which is going on in the brain and the nerves.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The whole structure. One can see that this materialistic reaction can end. And the next question I am asking is whether that emptiness is within or without. (Without, in the sense of being elsewhere.)</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Where would it be?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t think it would be elsewhere, but I am just putting the question...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, any such thing is a material process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It is in the mind itself. Not outside it. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now what is the next step? Does that emptiness contain nothing? Not a thing?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not a thing, by which we mean anything that has form, structure, stability.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. All that, form, structure, reaction, stability, capacity. Then what is it? Is it then total energy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, movement of energy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Movement of energy. It is not movement of reaction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not movement of things reacting to each other. The world can be regarded as made up of a number of things which react to each other and that is one kind of movement: but we are saying it is a different kind of movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Entirely different.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is no thing in it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No thing in it, and therefore it is not of time. Is that possible? Or are we just indulging in imagination? In some kind of romantic, hopeful, pleasurable sensation? I don’t think that we are, because we have been through all that, step by step, right up to this point. So we are not deceiving ourselves. Now we say that emptiness has no centre, as the ‘me’, and all the reactions. In that emptiness there is a movement of timeless energy.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>When you refer to timeless energy, we could repeat what we have already said about time and thought being the same.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then you were saying that time can only come into a material process?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now if we have energy that is timeless but nevertheless moving...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, not static...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then what is the movement?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is movement from here to here?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is one form.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>One form. Or from yesterday to today, and from today to tomorrow.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There are various kinds of movement.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what is movement? Is there a movement which is not a movement? You understand? Is there a movement which has no beginning and no end? Unlike thought which has a beginning and an end.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Except you could say that the movement of matter might have a beginning and no ending; the reactive movement. You are not speaking of that?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, I am not talking of that. Thought has a beginning and thought has an ending. There is a movement of matter as reaction, and the ending of that reaction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In the brain.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But there are various kinds of movements. That is all we know. And someone comes along and says there is a totally different kind of movement. But to understand that, we must be free of the movement of thought, and the movement of time, to understand a movement that is not...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well there are two things about this movement. It has no beginning and no end, but also it is not determined as a series of successions from the past.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. No causation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you see, matter can be looked at as a series of causes; it may not be adequate. But now you are saying that this movement has no beginning and no ending; it is not the result of a series of causes following one another.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So I want to understand verbally a movement that is not a movement. I don’t know if I am making it clear?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then why is it called a movement if it is not a movement?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because it is not still, it is active.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is energy.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It has tremendous energy; therefore it can never be still. But in that energy it has stillness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think we have to say that the ordinary language does not convey this properly, but the energy itself is still, and also moving.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But in that movement is a movement of stillness. Does it sound crazy?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The movement can be said to emerge from stillness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. You see, that is what it is. We said that this emptiness is in the mind. It has no cause and no effect. It is not a movement of thought, of time. It is not a movement of material reactions. None of that. Which means, is the mind capable of that extraordinary stillness without any movement? When it is so completely still, there is a movement out of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think I mentioned before that some people, like Aristotle, had this notion in the past; we discussed it. He talked about the unmoved mover, when trying to describe God, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah, God, no. I don’t want to do that!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You don’t want to describe God, but some sort of notion similar to this has been held in the past by various people. Since then it has gone out of fashion, I think.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s bring it into fashion, shall we?!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I am not saying that Aristotle had the right idea. It is merely that he was considering something somewhat similar, though probably different in many respects.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Was it an intellectual concept or an actuality?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This is very hard to tell because so little is known.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Therefore we don’t have to bring in Aristotle.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I merely wanted to point out that the concept of a movement of stillness wasn’t crazy, because other very respectable people had had something similar.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am glad! I am glad to be assured that I am not crazy!</p>
<p>And is that movement out of stillness the movement of creation? We are not talking of what the poets, writers and painters call creation. To me, that is not creation; just capacity, skill, memory and knowledge operating. Here I think this creation is not expressed in form.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is important to differentiate. Usually we think creation is expressed in form, or as structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, structure. We have gone beyond being crazy, so we can go on! Would you say that this movement, not being of time, is eternally new?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. It is eternally new in the sense that the creation is eternally new. Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Creation is eternally new. You see that newness is what the artists are trying to discover. Therefore they indulge in all kinds of absurdities, but few come to that point where the mind is absolutely silent, and out of that silence there is this movement which is always new. The moment when that movement is expressed...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...the first expression is in thought?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is just it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And that may be useful, but then it gets fixed, and becomes a barrier.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I was told once by an Indian scholar that before people began to sculpt the head of a god, or whatever, they had to go into deep meditation. At the right moment they took up the hammer and the chisel.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then it came out of the emptiness. There is another point, you see. The Australian aborigines draw figures in the sand, so that they don’t have permanency.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps thought could be looked at that way. You see, marble is too static, and remains for thousands of years. So although the original sculptor may have understood, the people who follow see it as a fixed form.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What relationship has all this to my daily life? In what way does it act through my actions, through my ordinary physical responses, to noise, to pain, various forms of disturbance? What relationship has the physical to that silent movement?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, in so far as the mind is silent, the thought is orderly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We are getting on to something. Would you say that the silent movement, with its unending newness, is total order of the universe?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We could consider that the order of the universe emerges from this silence and emptiness.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what is the relationship of this mind to the universe?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The particular mind?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No; mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Mind in general?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Mind. We went through the general and the particular, and beyond that there is the mind.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Would you say that is universal?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t like to use the word universal.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Universal in the sense of that which is beyond the particular. But perhaps that word is difficult.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Can we find another word? Not global. A mind that is beyond the particular?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well you could say it is the source, the essence. It has been called the absolute.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I don’t want to use the word ‘absolute’, either.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The absolute means literally that which is free of all limitations, of all dependence.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>All right, if you agree that ‘absolute’ means freedom from all dependence and limitation.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>From all relationships.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then we will use that word.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It has unfortunate connotations.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. But let’s use it for the moment just for convenience in our dialogue. There is this absolute stillness, and in or from that stillness there is a movement, and that movement is everlastingly new. What is the relationship of that mind to the universe?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>To the universe of matter?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To the whole universe: matter, trees, nature, man, the heavens.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is an interesting question.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The universe is in order; whether it is destructive or constructive, it is still order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, the order has the character of being absolutely necessary; in a sense it cannot be otherwise. The order that we usually know is not absolutely necessary. It could be changed; it could depend on something else.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The eruption of a volcano is order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is order of the whole universe.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. Now in the universe there is order, and this mind which is still is completely in order.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The deep mind, the absolute.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The absolute mind. So, is this mind the universe?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In what sense is that the universe? We have to understand what it means to say that, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>It means, is there a division, or a barrier, between this absolute mind and the universe? Or are both the same?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Both are the same.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is what I want to get at.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have either duality of mind and matter, or they are both the same.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. Is that presumptuous?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Not necessarily. I mean that these are just two possibilities.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I want to be quite sure that we are not treading upon something which really needs a very subtle approach - which needs great care. You know what I mean?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Let’s go back to the body. We have said that the mind which is of the body - thought, feeling, desire, the general and the particular mind - is part of the material process.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Absolutely.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And not different from the body.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. All the reactions are material processes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And therefore what we usually call the mind is not different from what we call the body.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now you are making this much greater in saying, consider the whole universe. And we ask if what we call the mind in the universe is different from what we call the universe itself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right. You see why I feel that in our daily life there must be order, but not the order of thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, thought is a limited order, it is relative.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. So there must be an order that is...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...free of limitation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. In our daily life we have to have that - which means no conflict, no contradiction whatsoever.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s take the order of thought. When it is rational it is in order. But in contradiction the order of thought has broken down, it has reached its limit. Thought works until it reaches a contradiction, and that’s the limit.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So if in my daily life there is complete order, in which there is no disturbance, what is the relationship of that order to the never ending order? Can that silent movement of order, of that extraordinary something, affect my daily life, when I have inward psychological order? You understand my question?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. We have said, for example, that the volcano is a manifestation of the whole order of the universe.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Absolutely. Or a tiger killing a deer.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The question then is whether a human being in his ordinary life can be similar.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s it. If not, I don’t see what is the point of the other - the universal.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it has no point to the human being. You see, some people would say, who cares about the universe. All we care about is our own society, and what we are doing. But then that falls down, because it is full of contradiction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously. It is only thought which says that.</p>
<p>So that universe, which is in total order, does affect my daily life.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. I think that scientists might ask how. You see, one might say, I understand that the universe is constituted of matter, and that the laws of matter affect our daily life. But it is not so clear how it affects the mind; and if there is this absolute mind which affects the daily life.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah! What is my daily life? Disorderly, and a series of reactions. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it is mostly that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And thought is always struggling to bring order within that. But when it does that, it is still disorder.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because thought is always limited by its own contradictions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Thought is always creating disorder, because it is itself limited.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>As soon as it tries to go beyond the limit, that is disorderly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Right. I have understood, I have gone into it, I have an insight into it, so I have a certain kind of order in my life. But that order is still limited. I recognize that, and I say that this existence is limited.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now some people would accept that, and say ‘Why should you have more?’</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not having more.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But others might say, ‘We would be happy if we could live in a material life, with real order.’</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I say, let’s do it! It must be done! But in the very doing of it, one has to realize it is limited.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, even the highest order that we can produce is limited.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And the mind realizes its limitation and says, let’s go beyond it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why? Some people would say, why not be happy within those limits, continually extending them, trying to discover new thoughts, new order? The artist will discover new forms of art, the scientists a new kind of science.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But all that is always limited.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is often the feeling that we can go this far, and accept that this is all that is possible.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>You mean the feeling that we must accept the human condition?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, people would say that man could do much better than he is doing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but all this is still the human condition, a little reformed, a little better.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Some people would say enormously reformed.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But it is still limited!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Let’s try to make clear what is wrong with the limitation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>In that limitation there is no freedom, only a limited freedom.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. So eventually we come to the boundary of our freedom. Something makes us react, through reaction we fall back into contradiction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, but what happens when I see that I am always moving within a certain area...?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then I am under the control of the forces.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The mind inevitably rebels against that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is an important point. You see the mind wants freedom. Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It says that freedom is the highest value. So do we accept that, and see it just as a fact?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is, I realize that within this limitation I am a prisoner.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Some people get used to it and say, ‘I accept it.’</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I won’t accept it! My mind says there must be freedom from prison. I am a prisoner, and the prison is very nice, very cultured and all the rest of it. But it is still limited, although it says, there must be freedom beyond all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which mind says this? Is it the particular mind of the human being?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Ah! Who says there must be freedom? Oh, that is very simple. The very pain, the very suffering demands that we go beyond.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This particular mind, even though it accepts limitation, finds it painful.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And therefore this particular mind feels somehow that it is not right. But it can’t avoid it. There seems to be a necessity of freedom.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Freedom is necessary, and any hindrance to freedom is retrogression. Right?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That necessity is not an external necessity due to reaction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Freedom is not a reaction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The necessity of freedom is not a reaction. Some people would say that having been in prison you reacted in this way.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So where are we? You see, this means there must be freedom from reaction, freedom from the limitation of thought, freedom from all the movement of time. We know that there must be complete freedom from all that, before we can really understand the empty mind, and the order of the universe, which is then the order of the mind. We are asking a tremendous lot. Are we willing to go that far?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, you know that non-freedom has its attractions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, but I am not interested in these attractions.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But you asked the question, are we willing to go that far? So it seems to suggest that there may be something attractive in this limitation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. I have found safety, security, pleasure in non-freedom. I realize that in pleasure or pain there is no freedom. The mind says, not as a reaction, that there must be freedom from all this. To come to that point and to let go without conflict, demands its own discipline, its own insight. That’s why I said to those of us who have done a certain amount of investigation into all this, can one go as far as that? Or do the responses of the body - the responsibilities of daily action, for one’s wife, children, and all that - prevent this sense of complete freedom? The monks, the saints, and the sannyasis have said, ‘You must abandon the world.’</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We went into that.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That is another form of idiocy, although I’m sorry to put it like that. We have been through all that, so I refuse to enter again into it. Now I say are the universe and the mind that has emptied itself of all this, one?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Are they one?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>They are not separate, they are one.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So you are saying that the material universe is like the body of the absolute mind.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, all right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It may be a picturesque way of putting it!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We must be very careful also not to fall into the trap of thinking that the universal mind is always there.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>How would you put it then?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Man has said that God is always there; Brahman, or the highest principle, is always present, and all you have to do is to cleanse yourself, and arrive at that. This is also a very dangerous statement, because then you might say, there is the eternal in me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But I think that is projecting.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is a logical difficulty in saying it is always there because ‘always’ implies time, and we are trying to discuss something that has nothing to do with time. So we can’t place it as being here, there, now or again!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have come to the point that there is this universal mind, and the human mind can be of that when there is freedom.</p>

<h1>15. Can Personal Problems be Solved, and Fragmentation End?</h1>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have cultivated a mind that can solve almost any technological problem. But apparently human problems have never been solved. Human beings are drowned by their problems: the problems of communication, knowledge, of relationships, the problems of heaven and hell; the whole human existence, has become a vast, complex problem. And apparently throughout history it has been like this. In spite of his knowledge, in spite of his centuries of evolution, man has never been free of problems.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">David Bohm: </span>Yes, of insoluble problems.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I question if human problems are insoluble.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I mean, as they are put now.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>As they are now, of course, these problems have become incredibly complex and insoluble. No politician, scientist, or philosopher is going to solve them, even through wars and so on! So why have human beings throughout the world not been able to resolve the daily problems of life? What are the things that prevent the complete solution of these problems? Is it that we have never turned our minds to it? Is it because we spend all our days, and probably half the night, in thinking about technological problems so that we have no time for the other?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is partly so. Many people feel that the other should take care of itself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But why? I am asking in this dialogue whether it is possible to have no human problems at all - only technological problems, which can be solved. But human problems seem insoluble. Is it because of our education, our deep-rooted traditions, that we accept things as they are?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that is certainly part of it. These problems accumulate as civilization gets older, and people keep on accepting things which make problems. For example, there are now far more nations in the world than there used to be, and each one creates new problems.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If you go back in time...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...a tribe becomes a nation...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And then the group must fight its neighbour.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Men use this marvellous technology to kill each other. But we are talking about problems of relationships, problems of lack of freedom, this sense of constant uncertainty and fear, the struggle to work for a livelihood for the rest of one’s life. The whole thing seems so extraordinarily wrong.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think people have lost sight of that. Generally speaking they accept the situation in which they find themselves, and try to make the best of it, trying to solve some small problems to alleviate their circumstances. They wouldn’t even look at this whole situation seriously.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But the religious people have created a tremendous problem for man.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. They are trying to solve problems too. I mean everybody is caught up in his own little fragment, solving whatever he thinks he can solve, but it all adds up to chaos.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To chaos and wars! That is what we are saying. We live in chaos. But I want to find out if I can live without a single problem for the rest of my life. Is that possible?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I wonder if we should even call these things problems, you see. A problem would be something that is reasonably solvable. If you put the problem of how to achieve a certain result, then that presupposes that you can reasonably find a way to do it technologically. But psychologically, the problem cannot be looked at in that way; to propose a result you have to achieve, and then find a way to do it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What is the root of all this? What is the cause of all this human chaos? I am trying to come to it from a different angle, to discover whether there is an ending to problems. You see, personally, I refuse to have problems.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Somebody might argue with you about that and say that maybe you are not challenged with something.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I was challenged the other day about something very, very serious. That is not a problem.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then it is a matter of clarification. Part of the difficulty is clarification of the language.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Clarification, not only of language, but of relationship and action. A problem arose the other day which involved lots of people, and a certain action had to be taken. But to me personally it was not a problem.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We have to make it clear what you mean, because without an example, I don’t know.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I mean by a problem something that has to be resolved, something you worry about; something you are questioning, and endlessly concerned with. Also doubts and uncertainties, and having to take some kind of action which you will regret at the end.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s begin with the technical problem where the idea first arose. You have a challenge, something which needs to be done, and you say that is a problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is generally called a problem.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Now the word problem is based on the idea of putting forth something - a possible solution - and then trying to achieve it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or, I have a problem but I don’t know how to deal with it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If you have a problem and you have no idea how to deal with it...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>...then I go round asking people for advice, and getting more and more confused.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This would already be a change from the simple idea of a technical problem, where you usually have some notion of what to do.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I wonder if we do? Surely technical problems are fairly simple.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>They often bring challenges requiring us to go very deeply and change our ideas. With a technical problem, we generally know what we have to do to solve it. For example, if there is lack of food, what we have to do is to find ways and means of producing more. But with a psychological problem, can we do the same?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is the point. How do we deal with this thing?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, what kind of problem shall we discuss?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Any problem which arises in human relationships.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Let’s say that people cannot agree; they fight each other constantly.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, let’s take that for a simple thing. It seems to be almost impossible for a group of people to think together, to have the same outlook and attitude. I don’t mean copying each other, of course. But each person puts his opinion forward and is contradicted by another - which goes on all the time, everywhere.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>All right. So can we say that our problem is to work together, to think together?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Work together, think together, cooperate without the involvement of monetary issues.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is another question, whether people will work together if they are highly paid.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So how do we solve this problem? In a group, all of us are offering different opinions, and we don’t meet each other at all. And it seems almost impossible to give up one’s opinions.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is one of the difficulties, but I am not sure that you can regard it as a problem, and ask, what shall we do to give up opinions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, of course. But that is a fact. So observing that, and seeing the necessity that we should all come together, people still cannot give up their opinions, their ideas, their own experiences and conclusions.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Often it may not seem to them like an opinion, but the truth.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, they would call it fact. But what can man do about these divisions? We see the necessity of working together - not for some ideal, belief, some principle or some god. In various countries throughout the world, and even in the United Nations they are not working together.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Some people might say that we not only have opinions, but self-interest. If two people have conflicting self-interests, there is no way, as long as they maintain their attachment to these, that they can work together. So how do we break into this?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If you point out to me that we must work together, and show me the importance of it, then I also see that it is important. But I can’t do it!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That’s the point. It is not enough even to see that cooperation is important, and to have the intention of achieving this. With this inability there is a new factor coming in. Why is it that we cannot carry out our intentions?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>One can give many reasons for that, but those causes and reasons and explanations don’t solve the problem. We come back to the same thing - what will make a human mind change? We see that change is necessary, and yet are incapable or unwilling to change. What factor - what new factor - is necessary for this?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, I feel it is the ability to observe deeply whatever it is that is holding the person and preventing him from changing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So is the new factor attention?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, that is what I meant. But also, we have to consider what kind of attention.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>First let’s discuss what is attention.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It may have many meanings to different people.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, as usual, there are so many opinions!</p>
<p>Where there is attention, there is no problem. Where there is inattention, every difficulty arises. Now without making attention itself into a problem, what do we mean by it? Can we understand it, not verbally, not intellectually, but deeply, in our blood? Obviously attention is not concentration. It is not an endeavour, an experience, a struggle to be attentive. You must show me the nature of attention, which is that when there is attention, there is no centre from which ‘I’ attend.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but that is the difficult thing.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Don’t let’s make a problem of it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I mean that people have been trying this for a long time. I think that there is first of all some difficulty in understanding what is meant by attention, because of the content of thought itself. When a person is looking at it, he may think he is attending.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, in that state of attention there is no thought.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But how do you stop thought then? You see, while thinking is going on, there is an impression of attention - which is not attention. But one thinks, one supposes that one is paying attention.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>When one supposes one is paying attention, that is not it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So how do we communicate the true meaning of attention?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Or would you say rather that to find out what is attention, we should discuss what is inattention?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>And through negation come to the positive. When I am inattentive, what takes place? In my inattentiveness, I feel lonely, depressed, anxious, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The mind begins to break up and go into confusion.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Fragmentation takes place. And in my lack of attention, I identify myself with many other things.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, and it may be pleasant - but it can be painful too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I find, later on, that what was pleasing becomes pain.</p>
<p>So all that is a movement in which there is no attention. Right? Are we getting anywhere?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I don’t know.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I feel that attention is the real solution to all this - a mind which is really attentive, which has understood the nature of inattention and moves away from it!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But first, what is the nature of inattention?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Indolence, negligence, self-concern, self-contradiction - all that is the nature of inattention.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. You see, a person who has self-concern may feel that he is attending but he is simply concerned with himself.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. If there is self-contradiction in me, and I pay attention to it in order not to be self-contradictory, that is not attention.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But can we make this clear, because ordinarily one might think that this is attention.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, it is not. It is merely a process of thought, which says, ‘I am this, I must not be that’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So you are saying that this attempt to become, is not attention.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that’s right. Because the psychological becoming breeds inattention.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Isn’t it very difficult, Sir, to be free of becoming? That is the root of it. To end becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. There is no attention, and that is why these problems are there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, and when you point that out, the paying attention also becomes a problem.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The difficulty is that the mind plays tricks, and in trying to deal with this, it does the very same thing again.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Can the mind, which is so full of knowledge, self-importance, self-contradiction, and all the rest of it, come to a point where it finds itself psychologically unable to move?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There is nowhere for it to move.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>What would I say to a person who has come to that point? I come to you. I am full of this confusion, anxiety, and sense of despair, not only for myself but for the world. I come to that point, and I want to break through it. So it becomes a problem to me.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then we are back; there is again an attempt to become, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. That is what I want to get at. So is that the root of all this? The desire to become?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it must be close to it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So how do I look, without the movement of becoming, at this whole complex issue of myself?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems that one hasn’t looked at the whole. We did not look at the whole of becoming, when you said, ‘How can I pay attention?’ Part of it seemed to slip out, and became the observer. Right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Psychological becoming has been the curse of all this. A poor man wants to be rich, and a rich man wants to be richer, it is all the time this movement of becoming, both outwardly and inwardly. And though it brings a great deal of pain and sometimes pleasure, this sense of becoming, fulfilling, achieving psychologically, has made my life into all that it is. Now I realize that, but I can’t stop it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Why can’t I stop it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Let’s go into that. Partly I am concerned in becoming because there is a reward at the end of it; also I am avoiding pain or punishment. And in that cycle I am caught. That is probably one of the reasons why the mind keeps on trying to become something. And the other perhaps is deep rooted anxiety or fear that if I don’t become something, I am lost. I am uncertain and insecure, so the mind has accepted these illusions and says, I cannot end that process of becoming.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But why doesn’t the mind end it? Also we have to go into the question of being trapped by these illusions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>How do you convince me that I am caught in an illusion? You can’t, unless I see it myself. I cannot see it because my illusion is so strong. That illusion has been nurtured, cultivated by religion, by the family, and so on. It is so deeply rooted that I refuse to let it go. That is what is taking place with a large number of people. They say, ‘I want to do this but I cannot’. Now given that situation, what are they to do? Will explanations, logic and all the various contradictions, theories, help them? Obviously not.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Because it all gets absorbed into the structure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So what is the next thing?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, if they say, ‘I want to change’, there is also the wish not to change.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. The man who says, ‘I want to change’, has also at the back of his mind, ‘Really, why should I change?’ They go together.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So we have a contradiction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I have lived in this contradiction, I have accepted it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But why should I have accepted it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Because it is a habit.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But when the mind is healthy, it will not accept a contradiction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But our mind isn’t healthy. The mind is so diseased, so corrupt, so confused, that even though you point out all the dangers of this, it refuses to see them.</p>
<p>So how do we help a man who is caught in this to see clearly the danger of psychological becoming? Let’s put it that way. Psychological becoming implies identification with a nation, a group, and all that business.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, holding to opinions.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Opinions and beliefs; I have had an experience, it gives me satisfaction, I am going to hold on to it. How do you help me to be free of all this? I hear your words - they seem quite right, but I can’t move out of all that.</p>
<p>I wonder if there is another factor, another way of communication, which isn’t based on words, knowledge, explanations and reward and punishment. Is there another way of communicating? You see, in that too there is danger. I am sure there is a way which is not verbal, analytical or logical, which doesn’t mean lack of sanity.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps there is.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>My mind has always communicated with another with words, explanations and logic, or with suggestion. There must be another element which breaks through all that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It will break through the inability to listen.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, the inability to listen, the inability to observe, to hear, and so on. There must be a different method. I have met several men who have been to a certain saint, and in his company they say all problems are resolved. But when they go back to their daily life, they are back in the old game.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>There was no intelligence in it, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is the danger. That man, that saint, being quiet and non-verbal in the presence of that saint they feel quiet, and think that their problems are resolved.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But this is still from the outside.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. It is like going to church. In an ancient church, or cathedral, you feel extraordinarily quiet. It is the atmosphere, the structure - you know; the very atmosphere makes you feel quiet.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, it communicates what is meant by quietness, non-verbally.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is nothing. It is like incense!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is superficial.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Utterly superficial; like incense, it evaporates! So we push all that aside, and then what have we left? Not an outside agency, a god, or some saviour. What have I left? What is there that can be communicated, which will break through the wall that human beings have built for themselves?</p>
<p>Is it love? That word has become corrupted, loaded, dirty. But cleansing that word, is love the factor that will break through this clever analytical approach? Is love the element that is lacking?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, we have to discuss it; perhaps people are somewhat chary of that word.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am chary beyond words!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>And, therefore, as people resist listening, they will resist love too.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is why I said it is rather a risky word.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>We were saying the other day that love contains intelligence.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Which is care as well; we mean by love that energy which also contains intelligence and care; all that...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Now wait a minute: you have that quality and I am caught in my misery, anxiety, etc., and you are trying to penetrate with that intelligence this mass of darkness. How will you do it? Will that act? If not, we human beings are lost. You follow, Sir? Therefore we have invented Jesus, Buddha, Krishna - images which have become meaningless, superficial and nonsensical.</p>
<p>So what shall I do? I think that is the other factor. Attention, perception, intelligence and love - you bring all this to me, and I am incapable of receiving it. I say, ‘It sounds nice; I feel it, but I can’t hold it’. I can’t hold it, because the moment I go outside this room, I am lost!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That really is the problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, that is the real problem. Is love something outside, as heaven - and all that stuff is outside. Is love something outside, which you bring to me, which you awaken in me, which you give me as a gift - or, in my darkness, illusion and suffering, is there that quality? Obviously not, there can’t be.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Then where is it?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s just it. Love is not yours or mine; it is not personal, not something that belongs to anyone; love is not that.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>That is an important point. Similarly you were saying that isolation does not belong to any one person, although we tend to think of isolation as a personal problem.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. It is common ground for all of us. Also, intelligence is not personal.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But again, that goes contrary to the whole of our thinking, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Everybody says this person is intelligent, and that one is not. So this may be one of the barriers to the whole thing, that behind the ordinary everyday thought there is deeper thought of mankind, but we generally feel divided, and say these various qualities either belong to us, or they don’t belong to us.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. It is the fragmentary mind that invents all this.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It has been invented, but we have picked it up verbally and non-verbally, by implication, from childhood. Therefore it pervades, it is the ground of our thoughts, of all our perceptions. So this has to be questioned.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have questioned it - that grief is not my grief, grief is human, and so on.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But how are people to see that, because a person who is experiencing grief feels that it is his personal grief?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think it is partly because of our education, partly our society and traditions.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But it is implicit in our whole way of thinking. Then we have to jump out of that, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. To jump out of that becomes a problem, and then what am I to do?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Perhaps we can see that love is not personal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Earth is not English earth, or French earth, earth is earth!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I was thinking of an example in physics: if the scientist or chemist is studying an element such as sodium, he does not say it is his sodium, or that somebody else studies his sodium. And of course they compare notes, etc.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite. Sodium is sodium.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Sodium is sodium, universally. So we have to say that love is love, universally.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. But you see my mind refuses to see that, because I am so terribly personal, terribly concerned with ‘me and my problems’. I refuse to let that go. When you say sodium is sodium, it is very simple; I can see that. But when you say to me that grief is common to all of us, this is difficult.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>This can’t be done with time, but it took quite a while for mankind to realize that sodium is sodium, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is love something that is common to all of us?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, in so far as it exists, it has to be common.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It may not exist, but if it does, it has to be common.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I am not sure it does not exist. Compassion is not ‘I am compassionate’. Compassion is there, is something that is not ‘me’.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If we say compassion is the same as sodium, it is universal. Then every person’s compassion is the same.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Compassion, love, and intelligence. You can’t have compassion without intelligence.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>So we say intelligence is universal too!</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Obviously.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But we have methods of testing intelligence in particular people, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But perhaps that is all part of the thing that is getting in the way?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Part of this divisive, fragmentary way of thinking.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, there may be holistic thinking, although we are not in it yet.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Then holistic thinking is not thinking; it is some other factor.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Some other factor that we haven’t gone into yet.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>If love is common to all of us, why am I blind to it?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think partly because the mind boggles; it just refuses to consider such a fantastic change of concept in a way of looking.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>But you said just now that sodium is sodium.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>You see, we have a lot of evidence for that in all sorts of experiments, built up through a lot of work and experience. Now we can’t do that with love. You can’t go into a laboratory and prove that love is love.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, no. Love isn’t knowledge. Why does one’s mind refuse to accept a very obvious factor? Is it the fear of letting go my old values, standards and opinions?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think it is probably something deeper. It is hard to pin down, but it isn’t a simple thing, although what you suggest is a partial explanation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is a superficial explanation, I know. Is it the deep-rooted anxiety, the longing to be totally secure?</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But that again is based on fragmentation.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>If we accept that we are fragmented, we will inevitably want to be totally secure, because being fragmented we are always in danger.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Is that the root of it? This urge, this demand, this longing to be totally secure in our relationship with everything? To be certain?</p>
<p>Of course, there is complete security only in nothingness!</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is not the demand for security which is wrong, but the fragmentations. The fragment cannot possibly be secure.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That is right. Like each country trying to be secure, it is not secure.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>But complete security could be achieved if all the countries got together. The way you have put it sounds as if we should live eternally in insecurity, you see.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No, we have made that very clear.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It makes sense to ask for security, but we are going about it the wrong way. How do we convey that love is universal, not personal, to a man who has lived completely in the narrow groove of personal achievement? It seems the first point is, will he question his narrow, ‘unique’ personality?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>People question it; they see the logic of what we are discussing, yet, curiously, people who are very serious in these matters, have tried to find the wholeness of life through starvation, through torture - you know, every kind of way. But you can’t apprehend or perceive or be the whole through torture. So what shall we do? Let’s say I have a brother who refuses to see all this. And as I have great affection for him, I want him to move out of fragmentation. And I have tried to communicate with him verbally, and sometimes non-verbally, by a gesture or by a look; but all this is still from the outside. And perhaps that is the reason why he resists. Can I point out to my brother that in himself this flame can be awakened? It means he must listen to me, but my brother refuses to listen.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It seems that there are some actions which are not possible. If a person is caught in a certain thought such as fragmentation, then he can’t change it, because there are a lot of other thoughts behind it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Thoughts he doesn’t know. He is not actually free to take this action because of the whole structure of thought that holds him.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>So how do I help - I use that word with great caution - my brother? What is the root of all this? We talk of his becoming aware - but all that is verbal; it can be explained in different ways - the cause, the effect, and all the rest of it. After I explain all this, he says, ‘You have left me where I am’. And my intelligence, my affection, says ‘I can’t let him go’. Which means, am I putting pressure on him?</p>
<p>I am not using any kind of pressure, or reward; my responsibility is that I can’t let another human being go. It is not the responsibility of duty and all that dreadful stuff. But it is the responsibility of intelligence to say all that to him. There is a tradition in India that one who is called the Maitreya Buddha took a vow that he would not become the ultimate Buddha until he had liberated other human beings too.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Altogether?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes. You see, the tradition hasn’t changed anything. How can one, if one has that intelligence, that compassion, that love, which is not of a country, a person, an ideal or a saviour, transmit that purity to another? By living with him, talking to him? You see it can all become mechanical.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Would you say that this question has never really been solved?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I think so. But we must solve it, you follow? It has not been solved, but our intelligence says, solve it. No, I think intelligence doesn’t say solve it; intelligence says these are the facts, and perhaps some will capture it.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, it seems to me that there are really two factors: one is the preparation by reason to show that it all makes sense; and from there possibly some will capture it.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have done that, Sir. The map has been laid out, and he has seen it very clearly; the conflicts, the misery, the confusion, the insecurity, the becoming. All that is extremely clear. But at the end of the chapter he is back at the beginning. Or perhaps he has a glimpse of it, and his craving to capture that glimpse and hold on to it becomes a memory. You follow? And all the nightmare begins!</p>
<p>In showing him the map very clearly, can we also point out to him something much deeper than that, which is love? He is groping after all this. But the weight of body, brain, tradition - all that draws him back. So it is a constant battle - and I think the whole thing is so wrong.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>What is wrong?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The way we are living.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Many people must see that by now.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>We have asked whether man has taken a wrong turning, and entered into a valley where there is no escape. That can’t be so; that is too depressing, too appalling.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think some people might object to that. The very fact that it is appalling does not make it untrue. I think you would have to give some stronger reason why you feel that to be untrue.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Do you perceive in human nature some possibility of a real change?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course. Otherwise everything would be meaningless; we’d be monkeys, machines. You see, the faculty for radical change is attributed to some outside agency, and therefore we look to that, and get lost in that. If we don’t look to anybody, and are completely free from dependence, then solitude is common to all of us. It is not an isolation. It is an obvious fact that when you see all this - the stupidity and unreality of fragmentation and division - you are naturally alone. That sense of aloneness is common, and not personal.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes, but the ordinary sense of loneliness is personal in the sense that each person feels it is his own.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Loneliness is not solitude; it is not aloneness.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think all the fundamental things are universal, and therefore you are saying that when the mind goes deep, it comes into something universal.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>That’s right.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Whether or not you call it absolute.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>The problem is to make the mind go very, very deeply into itself.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Yes. Now there is something that has occurred to me. When we start with a particular problem our mind is very shallow, then we go to something more general. The word ‘general’ has the same root as ‘to generate’, the genus is the common generation...</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>To generate, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>When we go to something more general, a depth is generated. But going on, still further, the general is still limited because it is thought.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Quite right. But to go profoundly, requires not only tremendous courage, but the sense of constantly pursuing the same stream.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>Well, that is not quite diligence; that is still too limited, right?</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Yes, diligence is too limited. It goes with a religious mind in a sense that it is diligence in its action, its thoughts and so on, but it is still limited. If the mind can go from the particular to the general and from the general...</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>...to the absolute, to the universal. But many people would say that is very abstract, and has nothing to do with daily life.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>I know. Yet it is the most practical thing, and not an abstraction.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>In fact, it is the particular that is the abstraction.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Absolutely. The particular is the most dangerous.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>It is also the most abstract, because you only get to the particular by abstracting.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>Of course, of course.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>I think that this may be part of the problem. People feel they want something that really affects us in daily life; they don’t just want to get themselves lost in talking, therefore, they say, ‘All these vapid generalities don’t interest us’.</p>
<p>It is true that what we are discussing must work in daily life, but daily life does not contain the solution of its problems.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>No. The daily life is the general and the particular.</p>
<p class="q"><span class="q">Bohm: </span>The human problems which arise in daily life cannot be solved there.</p>
<p class="k"><span class="k">Krishnamurti: </span>From the particular, it is necessary to move to the general; from the general to move still deeper, and there perhaps is the purity of what is called compassion, love and intelligence. But that means giving your mind, your heart, your whole being to this enquiry.</p>
<p>We have talked now for a long time, I think we have reached somewhere.</p>
